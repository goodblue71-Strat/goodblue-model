143 \nAI bubble concerns are back, and arguably more intense than \never, given a number of (worrying?) developments: a significant \nrise in the valuations of many AI-exposed companies, continued \nmassive investments in the AI buildout, and the increasing \ncircularity of the AI ecosystem, with model companies, \ninfrastructure providers, and hyperscalers signing deals with \neach other that are blurring the boundaries between customers, \nsuppliers, and capacity providers (see pg  Amid these \ndevelopments and growing worries that the megacap tech rally \nmay be masking signs of weakness in the broader market, \nwhether AI bubble concerns are warranted\u2014or overblown\u2014is \nTop of Mind  Sheridan notes that while some \nfeatures of the current period rhyme with past bubbles, and the \ncircularity of deals warrants caution, public market valuations \nand capital market activity levels remain below their Dot-Com \npeaks  So, he seems less inclined to call the situation in the \npublic market a bubble today, though he concedes that \u201cAI may \njust not be a bubble yet  He more broadly worries about companies\u2019 \nincreased reliance on debt to fund their AI ambitions (GS credit \nstrategists Shamshad Ali and Ben Shumway quantify this debt \nbuildup on pg    \nGS Chief Global Equity Strategist Peter Oppenheimer then digs \ndeeper into the equity market parallels to past bubbles, also \nfinding similarities but key differences\u2014namely, the US tech \nleaders\u2019 current strong fundamentals, balance sheets, and AI \nmarket position\u2014which lead him to agree with Sheridan that \nthe US equity market is not in a bubble\u2026 yet  GS Senior US \nEquity Strategist Ryan Hammond also shares this view, finding \nlittle evidence of US tech sector froth outside of smaller \npockets of the market like Quantum Computing   \nAll that said, Sheridan sees more reason to worry about the \nlarge gap between public and (higher) private market valuations \nof AI-exposed companies, with the latter largely based on \nrevenues rather than profits and margins \u201d  \nSo, Cahn sees substantial opportunity in AI application \ncompanies that largely reside in the private market today: \n\u201cPrices are elevated, but business model quality is high \u201d   \nByron Deeter, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, is less \nconcerned about the amount of capex pouring into the space, \nwith AI \u201creshaping businesses in ways previously \nunimaginable \u201d While he acknowledges that valuations are high \ntoday, he sees them as largely justified by AI firms\u2019 underlying \nfundamentals and revenue potential  And he views the \necosystem\u2019s circularity \u201cless as artificial inflation and more as a \nreflection of strategic interdependence across the AI value \nchain \u201d So, he believes that AI bubble concerns are overblown, \nand that \u201cthis isn\u2019t a \u2018hope-and-hype\u2019 cycle like the Dot-Com \nEra \u201d   \nAnd GS Head of the Global Economics team Joseph Briggs is \nperhaps the most optimistic about the AI capex boom, arguing \nthat the economic value generated by AI will ultimately justify \nthe spend  Specifically, he estimates that generative AI will \ncreate $20tn in economic value (in present-discounted value \nterms), $8tn of which will flow to US companies, as it unlocks \nsignificant productivity gains  And although the range of \noutcomes remains wide, he notes that plausible revenue \nestimates generally exceed current cumulative AI investment \nforecasts even before factoring in AGI\u2019s potential emergence, \nthough whether the firms making the investments today will be \nthe ultimate beneficiaries remains less clear    \nBut Gary Marcus, Professor Emeritus at New York University, \nremains skeptical about the promise of the technology in its \ncurrent form and the amount of capex being spent on it  Marcus \nexplains that generative AI remains far from AGI today despite \nsome incremental improvements over the past two years, with \nthe technology \u201cstill essentially autocomplete on steroids \u201d \nWhile he is encouraged by the industry\u2019s recent shift away from \nbelieving that large language models would be the solution to \nAGI and toward more promising approaches like neurosymbolic \nAI, he still sees significant challenges ahead on the road to AGI   \nSo, what does all this mean for how investors should be \npositioned? Within tech, Sheridan sees value in stocks well-\npositioned to benefit from potential AI disruption and \nunderappreciated growth stories, while Cahn and Deeter see \nsubstantial investment opportunity in the mostly-private AI \napplication layer     \nBut Oppenheimer also sees value in looking beyond the tech \nsector given the extreme level of market concentration today \nand ever-present risk of a market correction  He continues to \nrecommend diversifying across regions, factors, and sectors\u2014a \nstrategy that has paid off this year    \nAllison Nathan, Editor  \nEmail: allison  LLC    \n \nAI: in a bubble?  hEl \nGoldman Sachs Global Investment Research 4 \nTop of Mind Issue 143 \nEric Sheridan and Kash Rangan are Senior Equity Research Analysts at Goldman Sachs \ncovering US internet and software, respectively  Below, they argue that while some \ncharacteristics of the current period rhyme with past bubbles, we\u2019re not in an AI bubble today  \n \nAllison Nathan: When we last spoke \nin June 2024, you explained that \ncomputing cycles typically follow an \n\u201cIPA\u201d progression\u2014infrastructure \nfirst, platforms next, and \napplications last  Then, AI was very \nmuch in the infrastructure phase  \nWhere does it stand today, and how \ndoes that compare to expectations? \nEric Sheridan: The AI infrastructure \nbuildout is still very much ongoing, \nwith the amount of capital and spend \nsurprising to the upside as the demand \nfor computational power, or compute, \ncontinues to outstrip Nvidia\u2019s ability to \nprovide the chips fueling the compute  \nSo, the model companies, including \nthe hyperscalers, have been unable to \nscale inference\u2014the process by which \na trained AI model applies its knowledge to new data\u2014and \nlaunch more products  And at the application layer, \nmore consumer applications have emerged, mostly through the \nusage of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini, though \nsignificant monetization remains elusive as most consumers \ntoday are utilizing the free versions of these applications   \nKash Rangan: The infrastructure buildout has certainly gone on \nmuch longer than anybody expected as more foundational \nmodels have emerged  \nToday, six major foundational models are competing to be the \nmodel of the future: ChatGPT, Gemini, Anthropic\u2019s Claude, \nMicrosoft\u2019s Phi, Mistral\u2019s models, and xAI\u2019s Grok  These \nmodels are very hungry because they require training, which is \ndriving the significant demand for compute  Databricks, \nSnowflake, and MongoDB\u2014platform companies that provide \nsolutions for data management and storage for enterprise \nuse\u2014are all experiencing an acceleration in revenue growth \npartly owing to AI  Salesforce\u2019s Data Cloud, another AI-enabled \nplatform, is a nearly $1bn revenue business with a 100% \ngrowth rate  While enterprise AI \napplications have shown some signs of life, the revenue figures \nare well below where I expected them to be 1-2 years ago  Blackberries remained ubiquitous in the \ncorporate world for some time after consumers adopted the \niPhone because the consumer chose their preferred device \nuntethered from enterprise budget, compliance, and regulatory \nconsiderations  The AI application cycle is playing out the same \nway\u2014enterprises are trying to work within their existing IT \nbudgets, gain employee buy-in, and/or build products their \ncustomers want to adopt that may disrupt their own \nworkflows, which has resulted in a relatively slow pace of \nenterprise adoption   \nAllison Nathan: Amid these disappointments, is the still \nmassive amount of AI spend a reason to worry? \nKash Rangan: Some faith exists in the US capital system that \nif we get AI right, it will do wonders for productivity, scientific \ndiscovery, etc  That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t \nbe any pain along the way  Companies are once again investing \nheavily in capacity, this time in the form of AI chips, data \ncenters, etc   \nEric Sheridan: The significant rise in AI spend has certainly led \nmany investors to question the potential ROI  Most investors \nwe speak to seem to struggle to justify the return profile on the \n$3-4 trillion of cumulative AI spend Nvidia estimates will occur \nby the end of the decade unless AI delivers on its enormous \neconomic and societal promises  So, AI could \nsurpass our wildest expectations, but visibility into the end \nstate remains elusive  And here \ntoo, I see no reason why the AI cycle will prove any different    \nAllison Nathan: So, especially given the high valuations of \nAI-exposed companies, are we in an AI bubble today? \nEric Sheridan: I am not trying to be flippant, but there has \nbeen more talk of an AI bubble over the last three years than of \nA discussion on artificial intelligence (AI) \n \n \n hEl \nGoldman Sachs Global Investment Research 5 \nTop of Mind Issue 143 \nthe Dot-Com and Housing Bubbles in their midst  Private market valuations are well above public market \nvaluations  Private companies are predominantly being valued \non revenue and incremental revenue growth, with seemingly \nless focus on profits and margins  Public companies, by \ncontrast, are still being evaluated on free cash flow, return on \ncapital, margins, and how they trade relative to the market  So, \nthe private and public markets are using two diametrically \ndifferent valuation frameworks, and history shows that a \nwidening between them can indicate risk in the system  \nOf course, public market valuations are also above historical \nnorms  Capital market \nactivity is also well below 1998-99 and 2007-08 levels, with the \naverage deal today also much larger, indicating a more selective \nIPO market  Now, that\u2019s arguably a duration argument\u2014AI may \njust not be a bubble yet  23x for the market, with Alphabet and Meta \ntrading only slightly above the market multiple\u2014generate \noutsized levels of free cash flow and engage in stock buybacks \nand pay dividends, which very few firms did in 1999  \nMany software stocks are trading at depressed valuations given \nconcerns that AI could disrupt their end-markets, whether \nthrough job dislocation or by enabling the writing of software in \na much more cost-effective manner, which would increase \ncompetition in the application software space   \nA larger story in the AI space that warrants watching is the \nemergence of a debt-fueled capital cycle  As we\u2019ve discussed, \nmost of the capital deployed to fund AI projects has so far \ncome from hyperscalers utilizing cash flows from their core \nbusinesses  Oracle recently completed \nan $18bn bond sale to fund its AI ambitions, and non-\nhyperscalers like CoreWeave have also secured significant debt \nfinancing   \nAllison Nathan: Are you worried this is a house of cards \nwith Nvidia investing in OpenAI, OpenAI pledging to spend \non compute from Oracle, Oracle buying Nvidia chips, etc     \nAllison Nathan: So, how should investors be positioned? \nEric Sheridan: Investors should focus on industries where AI is \neither disrupting the industry structure or re-accelerating \nrevenue growth  For example, AI will likely disrupt advertising \nprofit pools in the coming years  Investors can also find value in \nunderappreciated growth stories  \nAllison Nathan: What are you watching that could make \nyou less optimistic on the AI investment thesis? \nEric Sheridan: I continue to monitor utility, adoption, \nmonetization, and free cash flows  Ultimately, it would be \ndifficult to continue arguing the investment thesis if companies \nspend in a way that puts their free cash flow generation at real \nrisk, and that could represent a tipping point in the market  And if something goes wrong with AI, application \nsoftware companies would make good hedges because they \nhave been under AI-related duress  If AI doesn\u2019t live up to its \ndisruptive potential, these companies could benefit  hEl \nGoldman Sachs Global Investment Research 6 \nTop of Mind Issue 143 \nQ: How would you characterize the AI investing landscape, and what\u2014if anything\u2014does it remind you of? \nA: The AI investment opportunity is unprecedented  While we have experienced major transitions in software, with the first wave of \ncloud computing representing the closest analogy, the scale and scope of AI investments is unlike anything we've seen before  Companies like Anthropic and Perplexity, as well as sector-focused \nfirms such as Abridge and MaintainX, are at the forefront alongside established players like Canva and Intercom, which are reinventing \nthemselves through AI  And AI\u2019s impact extends beyond traditional technology layers, pulling in service revenues and reshaping \nbusinesses in ways previously unimaginable  So, AI truly represents the technology opportunity of our lifetimes  These developments \nwill be discussed for generations, and our grandchildren will recount the early days of AI as a pivotal moment in history  \nQ: Many question whether the return on AI investments will ever justify the huge amounts of AI capex  What\u2019s your view? \nA: The AI infrastructure layer is already scaling and monetizing in many ways  \nAI fundamentals are strong, and this value will inevitably roll through to the end-user through monetization, with applications capturing \nmuch of the value and the foundational model companies becoming the next generation of hyperscalers  Beyond the revenue story, \nAI\u2019s societal impact, in areas like education, healthcare, and scientific discovery, will arguably be some of the most enduring benefits  \nQ: Are concerns about AI being a bubble warranted, or overblown? \nA: Such concerns are overblown  Those thoughts sit heavily with me whenever people look at AI and \nsay that the valuations are crazy and investors need to pull back  To me, this is the cloud opportunity all over again  AI i s the next \nphase of cloud, and it is much bigger than the original  Unlike that era, many of today\u2019s leading AI companies\u2014OpenAI, \nAnthropic, and even emerging players like Databricks and Click House\u2014are already generating meaningful, recurring revenue with \nenterprise-grade customers  So, again, while valuations are certainly ambitious, tangible revenue growth and \nextraordinary market momentum support them  \nQ: Are you at all concerned that this is just a house of cards with Nvidia investing in OpenAI, OpenAI pledging to spend on \ncompute from Oracle, Oracle buying Nvidia chips, etc ? \nA: It\u2019s a fair concern  Some circularity exists in the ecosystem right now, with strategic investments often reinforcing each other\u2019s \ngrowth narratives  \nThat said, I see these relationships less as artificial inflation and more as a reflection of strategic interdependence across the AI value \nchain  Nvidia, for instance, has become a core supplier to nearly every player in the stack; Oracle\u2019s capital al location is a bet on \ncatching up in cloud; and OpenAI\u2019s commitments reflect genuine compute needs driven by user demand   The key question is \nwhether these relationships are backed by real, recurring usage\u2014and so far, the underlying demand for compute, model access, and \nAI-powered applications appears very real  In these especially dynamic markets, team matters much \nmore than ever  Incumbent firms are recognizing that and joining the AI bidding wars to recruit top researchers and scientists  The total addressable marke t for AI \u2014\nspanning chips, cloud infrastructure, model licensing, and downstream applications \u2014is likely an order of magnitude greater than \nprior software cycles  Real opportunity also exists for AI to take over services revenue  \nQ: How do you see the AI space evolving? \nA: A progression similar to previous tech waves will likely occur, with value moving from the infrastructure layer to the applic ation \nlayer  The AI wave is playing out similarly to the cloud wave, with Nvidia, Broadcom, and the hyperscalers monetizing first a nd the \nfoundational models following  It's been incredibly frustrating for public investors because the only way they can really take advantage \nis to gain exposure to the hardware companies, whereas the venture market is starting to see it working from the bottom up  So, public market investors have had much less \nexposure to the AI theme, while the private market opportunity has\u2014and likely will\u2014remain robust  Below, he argues that \nAI bubble concerns are overblown, with AI spend likely to eventually pay off  \n hEl \n \nGoldman Sachs Global Investment Research 7 \nTop of Mind Issue 143 \n \n \n \n \nNote: Exhibit does not represent an exhaustive view of the AI ecosystem but rather the most prominent AI model companies, inf rastructure providers, and hyperscalers    \nAI: an increasingly circular ecosystem \n hEl \n \nGoldman Sachs Global Investment Research 8 \nTop of Mind Issue 143 \nDavid Cahn is a Partner at Sequoia Capital  Below, he explains why the AI ecosystem has a \nlong way to go to generate the revenues necessary to justify current data center spending   \nHe argues that there is a capex bubble, but sees significant opportunity for AI long-term, \nespecially at the application layer \nAllison Nathan: Why did you decide \nto explore AI\u2019s $600bn question? \nDavid Cahn: I've been investing in AI \nfor about eight years  I was on the \nboard of Weights & Biases from the \nSeries A, Runway before they \ninvented Stable Diffusion, which is the \ntechnology behind all the AI image \ngenerators and video generators now, \nReplit, one of the AI coding companies, and backed \nHuggingFace  I'm very optimistic about AI  My core belief is \nthat when you and I are 80, AI is going to have fundamentally \nchanged the world  \nWhere my June 2024 piece, \u201cAI's $600B Question\u201d came \nfrom, originally AI's $200 billion question, is teasing out this \nlong-term optimism about AI and then narrowing in on today\u2019s \nspecific capex cycle  There's been this simplistic narrative of, \neither you're an AI bull or you're an AI bear  I've been trying to \ntease out nuance there, which is to say, you can believe that AI \nis going to be the greatest technology that humanity has ever \ninvented  And \nthat's because half of data center capex is energy and \ngenerators and batteries and things that are not AI chips  You got $100 billion of data center capex and $200 billion \nof implied revenue that you needed to generate for AI  And that \nwas the piece that went viral around AI's $600 billion question, \nwhich again was the same math, $150 billion of expected Q4 \nrun rate for Nvidia  Let\u2019s talk \nabout the supply chain a little bit  A lot of the AI debate and \ndiscussion tends to be myopically focused on specific \ncompanies  But it's more interesting in my \nview to look at the ecosystem and to think of AI as a supply \nchain  Especially a hardware supply chain   \nAny supply chain has a vertical stack top to bottom  And then under that, there's an OpenAI API   \nIn a healthy, mature supply chain, a dollar flows down the top \nfrom the customer and then some percentage of those dollars \ngo to each player in the supply chain  So Nvidia is capturing a lot of the value in \nthe supply chain today  And the second observation is that \nthere\u2019s not enough dollars coming in at the top, regardless of \nhow that dollar gets divided, so someone must be propping up \nthe supply chain, by definition  \nThat's a healthy, mature supply chain at the end of the day  So, \nthe question in AI is, how do we get to that kind of mature end \nstate, who pays for the burn along the way, and how deep in \nthe hole are they? Somebody is holding up the supply chain  That's \npropping up the supply chain  The supply chain wouldn't work \nwithout Microsoft doing that  Microsoft and the \ncloud giants were playing this pivotal role where they were \nholding up everybody else in the supply chain  If we ask ourselves, \nwhat is the biggest change in AI in the last 12 months? I think it \nis Microsoft and Amazon stepping back and a new set of \nplayers stepping forward to fill their shoes  It's not \nlike they've built a small amount of AI data center capacity  \nThe narrative on Wall Street is that these companies are not \nbullish enough on AI because they don't want to build more \ndata center capacity and they're fundamentally losers, whereas \nOracle and companies like this are winners  I\u2019m fascinated by these \nkinds of human dynamics and how they influence markets, \nwhich I try to tease out in my writing \n \nAllison Nathan: Are we in an AI bubble? \nDavid Cahn: It's the tale of two AIs\u2014maybe even the tale of \nthree AIs  There's three things that people talk \nabout in AI  That\u2019s fundamentally \na public market phenomenon  \nSecond, there are AI applications, and that is ChatGPT, which is \nan amazing business, that is Anthropic, that is Cursor, and \nthat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to invest in  This is a second element of AI, the application \nlayer  \nThe third AI story is AGI, which is a whole different topic  \nAllison Nathan: The circularity of investments on the \ncompute side have made the market nervous  How \nsustainable is all of that? \nDavid Cahn: One thing that's happening on these circular deals \nis that we are substituting dollars for gigawatts  One is that we're going to have \n100 gigawatts of energy built out for AI by 2030  Using \nmy AI $600 billion math, you double that to get the implied \nrevenue that you need to generate, and we're now at AI's $8 \ntrillion question  And then you double that and you get AI's $20 trillion \nquestion  I don't actually \nhave a view on 15-year AI demand  Is there anything that \nwe've missed that you wanted to cover? \nDavid Cahn: My closing thought would be, AI is going to \nchange the world  People who try to narrow this down into AI-\ngood or AI-bad are incorrect  AI is probably the most important \ntechnology of the next 50 years  I think it's crazy not to factor AI into your thinking \nabout your future career and what type of business to work in  But for most people, the real question \nis, how do you lever your life to AI in some way?  \nThis is the tension  On the other hand, most people are probably not \nchanging their lives enough to factor in how AI is going to \nchange their lives   hEl \n \nGoldman Sachs Global Investment Research 10 \nTop of Mind Issue 143 \nJoseph Briggs argues that the economic \nvalue generated by generative AI will \nultimately justify the AI capex boom \nSince mid-2023, we have anticipated a large AI investment \ncycle driven by an initial surge in hardware spend to train AI \nmodels and run AI queries  But the size, speed, and circularity \nof recent AI investment announcements have raised questions \naround the sustainability of AI capex  Despite these concerns, \nwe continue to see current investment levels as sustainable, \nthough it is less clear whether companies making the \ninvestments today will emerge as AI winners  \nAI investment has risen by around $200-300bn since 2023 \nAnnualized AI hardware spending in US national accounts, chg vs   \nCapex drivers remain supportive \nThe technological backdrop remains supportive of AI capex for \ntwo reasons    \nFirst, generative AI still appears set to deliver rapid acceleration \nin task automation that will drive labor cost savings and boost \nproductivity  Academic studies and company \nanecdotes support this, pointing to 25-30% average productivity \ngains following AI application deployment  While use cases \nremain fairly narrow, these early estimates highlight generative \nAI\u2019s potential to deliver transformative productivity uplifts  \nSecond, unlocking these productivity gains requires significant \ncomputational power and energy, with recent trends \nsuggesting that demand for both will continue rising  The \ncomputational power necessary to train LLMs continues to \ngrow more rapidly (floating-point operations (FLOPs); 400% per \nyear) than computational costs are falling (FLOPs/$; 40% per \nyear)  Training queries (350%) and the number of frontier AI \nmodels (125%) are also growing rapidly, while energy \nefficiency is improving but at a relatively slower pace (40%)  \nThe punchline is that the differential between demand growth \nand computing cost declines remains wide    \nDemand growth will likely continue outpacing technological \ncost declines in the near term, partly because frontier LLMs \ncontinue to improve with size    \nSizing generative AI\u2019s macroeconomic value \nWe also still see the macroeconomic justification for AI  \ninvestment as compelling and are less concerned about the \ndollar amount of AI capex    \nMany have flagged the unprecedented amount of AI capex \ncurrently being deployed, with the cumulative AI-driven data \ncenter and infrastructure buildout likely to total multi-trillions of

discounted value of AI capital revenues, $tn \n \nSource: Goldman Sachs GIR   \nThe key takeaway is that the PDV of generative AI capital \nrevenue exceeds projected AI-related capex both under our \nbaseline and alternative assumptions, suggesting that current \nand anticipated levels of AI capex are justified  We reach this \nconclusion without factoring in potential foreign profits, new \nprofit pools, and the emergence of AGI, suggesting a \nmeaningful cushion to the AI spending outlook  \nMarket structure and distribution of revenue \nWhile the macro backdrop still looks solid, we see valid \nconcerns around whether companies making AI investments \ntoday will benefit from this spending  This will depend critically \non the timing and distribution of revenues across the AI stack  \nOn timing, investment in semiconductors and servers\u2014which \naccount for $112bn of the $240bn in AI spend in the US \nnational accounts, respectively\u2014will depreciate quickly given \nthe rapid improvements in computing hardware  We estimate \nan 18% depreciation rate for current AI capex, raising potential \nfor a mismatch between the timing of infrastructure build and \nrevenue realization\n1    \nTiming considerations may be less important if AI investors can \ncapture an outsized share of the long-run value, but \u201cfirst-\nmovers\u201d have shown mixed performance in prior infrastructure \nbuilds  As was the case for UK canals in the late 1700s and early \n1800s, US IT investment in the 1980s and 1990s, and (in \nsome cases) for US railroads in the 1800s, first movers can \ncommand outsized returns due to high investment and \nswitching costs  In many cases\u2014including the buildout of UK railroads in \nthe 1800s and more recent buildout of fiber optic cables \nand US telecom\u2014first-mover returns were quite poor, as \nan initial overbuild gave way to a subsequent bust that \nallowed \u201cfast followers\u201d to capture outsized returns by \npurchasing assets at low valuations    \nThese historical precedents highlight that a complex set of \nfactors, including timing, regulation, and market competition, \ndetermine the ultimate winners from infrastructure builds  \nThe current AI stack\u2019s market structure provides limited clarity \ninto whether the companies leading AI investments today will \nbe long-run AI winners  Competition is high at the application \nlayer, reasonably high at the foundational model (despite \nOpenAI\u2019s lead) and data center layer, and more limited at the \nsemiconductor layer (where Nvidia dominates design and \nTSMC dominates production)  On the surface, this suggests \noutsized returns for AI hardware providers, consistent with the \npricing of the AI trade so far     \nThe key question for investment sustainability, however, is \nwhether incumbent advantages at the foundational model \nlayer\u2014i , the hyperscalers that are driving AI capex today\u2014\nwill lead to outsized returns over the longer-run that justify \ncontinued investment  History again provides mixed signals  Along these lines, the high \ncosts of AI investment, OpenAI and other hyperscalers\u2019 recent \nmoves to lock up key computing resources, and increasing \nsigns of vertical integration suggest that hyperscalers may be \nsuccessful in maintaining their first-mover advantage  \nOn the other hand, first-mover advantages have historically \nproven smaller when technology and market growth are \nhappening rapidly, IP protections are limited, or when \nsignificant uncertainty around end-user applications exists  \nThese patterns argue against the advantages for today\u2019s AI \nleaders that would justify sustained capex  \nOther key determinants of first-mover advantages remain \nuncertain  Similarly, it is unclear whether first movers will \nbenefit from network effects that yield advantages in \ndetermining product market standards and quality  \nThe case for continued spending \nUltimately, we think that the enormous economic value that \ngenerative AI promises justifies the current investment in AI \ninfrastructure, and that overall levels of AI investment appear \nsustainable as long as companies expect that investment today \nwill generate outsized returns over the long run     \nSo, we expect that the solid macro backdrop will support capex \nfor as long as companies believe that 1) first-mover advantage \nwill allow them to capture an outsized share of AI productivity-\nrelated revenues or 2) continued investment in compute \ncapacity will drive improvement in model performance and \npotential AGI development\u2014which could drive massive profits   \nJoseph Briggs, Head of the Global Economics team \nEmail: joseph  LLC

generative AI tools, the \ncore challenges persist, highlighting the need for an alternative approach to AI development \nJenny Grimberg: When we last \nspoke in July 2023, you were quite \ncritical of the capabilities of \ngenerative AI tools  While generative \nAI has been billed as tantamount to \nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI), it \nremains far from it  Some incremental technical improvements \nhave been made, and these tools are useful for tasks like \nbrainstorming and coding, but generative AI is still essentially \nautocomplete on steroids, trained to predict the next word in a \nsequence  Current AI tools lack a genuine understanding of the \nworld and struggle with reliably executing even basic tasks as \nissues like hallucinations and the inability to fact-check their \nown output persist   \nMany anticipated that subsequent iterations of AI models, such \nas ChatGPT-5, would miraculously solve these problems  So, AI\u2019s widely promised productivity gains and \ntransformative economic impact remain largely unrealized, and \nthe predicted billion-dollar businesses run by a single employee \nhave not materialized  In short, despite some improvements, \nthe fundamental challenges remain  \nJenny Grimberg: Since we last spoke, several companies\u2019 \nAI models have reportedly achieved medal-level \nperformance in the International Mathematical Olympiad \n(IMO), a difficult milestone that many people thought was \nyears away  Google\u2019s DeepMind has claimed notable \nprogress with its model, and to their credit, they used actual \nIMO judges to evaluate it  But the model has yet to be \nreleased, and its broader capabilities remain unknown  I expect \nthe model will excel in the math and coding, where it\u2019s possible \nto produce synthetic data tailored for training and verification  \nThis approach works for well-defined domains, such as solving \nquadratic equations, but it doesn\u2019t translate well to open-ended \nreal-world problems   \nTechnological developments are generally marked by a \nrecurring pattern of people claiming that \u201cthe next one\u201d will \nsolve this or that, but these promises don\u2019t often materialize  \nWhile I am almost certain that more advanced AI will eventually \nemerge, I don't see sufficient evidence in the technical \nliterature to suggest that we're close to that breakthrough  \nJenny Grimberg: What has gone wrong on a technical level \nthat has led generative AI to underdeliver on its \nproponents\u2019 promises of where the tech would be today? \nGary Marcus: The core issue is the reliance on black box \nstatistical AI with its opaque internal workings\u2014data is fed into \nthe model and results are generated, but what happens inside \ncan\u2019t be seen or traced  Unlike classical AI, which allows for the \nexamination of each step and debugging of errors directly, with \nLLMs, no clear way exists to pinpoint what went wrong in the \nevent of an error  The only real options are retraining the entire \nmodel or utilizing reinforcement learning to patch errors  So, \nthese systems have come to resemble the original Mechanical \nTurk, with teams of contractors working behind the scenes to \nmanually correct AI errors who never foresee everything that \nrequires fixing  So, committing \nfully to black box AI was a mistake, in my view  For years, the industry put their faith in so-called \nscaling laws\u2014the idea that bigger models would always yield \nbetter results\u2014which I have long cautioned against  However, \nwith recent disappointments surrounding releases like Llama 4, \nGrok 4, and GPT-5, it has become clear that scaling isn\u2019t \nyielding the hoped-for results, with the phrase \u201cdiminishing \nreturns\u201d entering mainstream discourse  \nJenny Grimberg: What alternatives do you see promise in? \nGary Marcus: One alternative that I have long advocated for, \nincluding in my book The Algebraic Mind, is neurosymbolic AI  \nNeurosymbolic AI combines two traditions in AI: neural \nnetworks, which are fast, statistical, and automatic\u2014akin to \nDaniel Kahneman\u2019s \u201cSystem 1\u201d thinking\u2014and classical AI, \nwhich uses symbolic reasoning, logic, and rule-based systems, \nmuch like Kahneman\u2019s \u201cSystem 2\u201d thinking  The aim is to \nintegrate both approaches to create more robust, interpretable, \nInterview with Gary Marcus \n \n hEl \n \nGoldman Sachs Global Investment Research 15 \nTop of Mind Issue 143 \nand flexible AI systems  For years, the industry dismissed this \nmethod, insisting that the brain doesn\u2019t use symbols despite \nclear evidence to the contrary from logicians, computer \nprogrammers, and even studies on infant cognition  The \ndominant AI approach became single feed-forward neural \nnetworks: input in, output out, with pattern recognition but little \ndeliberative reasoning  AlphaFold, an AI program developed by DeepMind that \npredicts protein structures, is the best example of \nneurosymbolic AI come to life   \nA core challenge remains: building AI models that can truly \nunderstand and represent the real world  While I'm often labeled as an AI critic, I am instead an \nAI realist\u2014I want AI to succeed, but I remain unconvinced that \nLLMs are the path forward  In \nmuch the same way, I expect that, eventually, a radically new \napproach to AI will emerge, sparking rapid and transformative \nadvances once the right paradigm is found  \nJenny Grimberg: Some AI model companies have \ngenerated large revenues  However, much of this revenue still stems from \ncompanies running proof-of-concept pilots rather than full-scale \ndeployments, leaving the sustainability of these revenues in \nquestion  The high and rising costs associated with generative \nAI\u2014especially as the industry shifts toward more resource-\nintensive domains like video generation\u2014further complicate the \npicture  OpenAI, for example, has seen its revenue increase \nsignificantly but is simultaneously burning through billions of \ndollars, setting new records for losses every quarter  Unless \nfuture AI models deliver dramatic breakthroughs\u2014rather than \nthe incremental improvements we\u2019ve seen so far\u2014the massive \nexpenditures are difficult to justify  \nJenny Grimberg: So, is AI in a bubble today? \nGary Marcus: AI is certainly in a financial bubble  As more companies build AI models, \nthe technology becomes commoditized, eliminating meaningful \ncompetitive advantages and driving down prices  Most revenue \nstill comes from developers, which may reach a few billion \ndollars annually, but this is dwarfed by the trillion-dollar \ninfrastructure investments that companies like OpenAI, \nMicrosoft, and Nvidia are making  So, their lofty valuations are \ndetached from actual profits, and even OpenAI\u2019s own \noptimistic forecasts don\u2019t anticipate profitability before 2030    \nUltimately, returns drive markets, and current AI ventures \naren\u2019t generating enough profit to justify their lofty valuations   \n \nWhile I'm often labeled as an AI critic, I \nam instead an AI realist \u201d \nJenny Grimberg: What else concerns you about AI today? \nGary Marcus: I remain deeply concerned about generative AI\u2019s \nbroader societal impact  The rise of generative AI technology \nhas enabled widespread automated disinformation that \nthreatens democracies worldwide, a proliferation of non-\nconsensual deepfakes, and a rise in cybercrime\u2014particularly \nthrough automated phishing attacks, which have become much \neasier to execute  Environmental costs are also mounting \nowing to AI data centers\u2019 immense energy demands  And with \nthe benefits so far largely limited to modest productivity gains \nfor programmers, generative AI currently appears to be a net \nnegative for society  Yet, we continue to allow AI companies to \noperate without meaningful regulation or accountability, \nconcentrating substantial power in the hands of a few  \nUltimately, regulation is needed to balance the costs and \nbenefits of generative AI technology, though such measures \nremain unpopular in Washington   hEl \n \nGoldman Sachs Global Investment Research 16 \nTop of Mind Issue 143 \nPeter Oppenheimer argues that the US equity \nmarket is not in a bubble\u2026 yet \nThe present market environment exhibits several \ncharacteristics that rhyme with previous bubbles, including a

Japan, and Canada, representing approximately \n16% of the entire global public equity market  And the ten \nlargest US stocks, eight of which are technology-related, \naccount for nearly 25% of the

the 1840s \n(UK) and 1873 (US), and the global Technology Bubble of the \n1990s\u2014which centered on a new technology or innovation that \ngenerated significant investor excitement, leading to substantial \ninvestment from both existing and new companies  One study \nfound that 73% of 51 major innovations between 1825 and \n2000 exhibited equity price bubbles, with their magnitude \nincreasing alongside the radicalness, potential for indirect \nnetwork effects, and public visibility of the innovations\n1  \nThe current enthusiasm for AI resonates with these historical \npatterns, particularly the Dot-Com Bubble of the late 1990s  A \ntechnological sea change appears to be at a critical \ncommercialization point, like the early internet, promising \nhigher future growth  However, this presents a threefold \nchallenge: accurately valuing the future market size, \ndetermining the timeline for commercialization and scaling, and \nidentifying the primary beneficiaries of future growth  The \ninherent uncertainty often leads investors to purchase options \nin numerous companies, hoping to identify the next dominant \nplayer  Ultimately, bubbles form

ambitions \nSince the rise of the generative AI theme in 2022, the five \nlargest AI hyperscalers (Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, \nOracle) have financed the majority of their AI-focused capex out \nof the large cash reserves on their balance sheets  And while the \nabsolute level of balance sheet liquidity remains substantial \nrelative to other industries, the downward trend marks a clear \nshift in how these firms are managing their liquidity positions   \nGrowing reliance on debt financing \nThe drawdown in cash balances has coincided with a growing \nreliance on debt financing\u2014a reflection of both shifting capital \nmanagement priorities and the scale of ongoing investment \nneeds tied to AI and cloud infrastructure  This trend has been \nvisible across many corners of the credit ecosystem, spanning \ntraditional bank lending, the asset-backed securities (ABS) \nmarket, and public and private debt markets  \nThe cash-to-total assets ratio for the five largest AI hyperscalers \nhas notably declined over recent years                                                                  \nCash and equivalents to total assets, % \n \nSource: Bloomberg,

\nincreased sharply  Year-to-date, the constituents of the US TMT \nAI Basket (ticker: GSTMTAIP, developed by the GS Global \nBanking & Markets division), which consists of companies that \nare pursuing AI or can help enable new technologies, have \ncollectively issued $139bn worth of corporate bonds, \nrepresenting ~9  Disclosure around the use \nof proceeds in the investment grade market has typically \nlimited granularity, but we suspect a meaningful share of this \nyear\u2019s issuance has been directed toward capex 2bn investment grade-rated private placement debt issue, \nthe single largest bond issue recorded in the USD IG market  The same trend has \nprevailed in structured finance markets, where certain vehicles \nprovide data center operators with the flexibility to raise debt \nincrementally, as long as they remain within pre-defined limits \non leverage and debt servicing capacity  However, our portfolio \nstrategy team sees significant upside risk to this estimate, \nimplying that the recent shift toward greater reliance on debt \nfinancing will likely persist and potentially intensify ahead  \nWhile not yet a cause for alarm given both the high cash flow \ngeneration and low leverage among large tech companies, the \nshifting funding mix of capex beyond cash suggests balance \nsheet leverage will likely grow, which is negative for credit \nquality in the corporate bond market, albeit only marginally   \nAnother way to invest in AI \nFor structured credit investors, the growth of data center ABS \nand CMBS markets offers a viable way to express a positive \nview on AI  Such an \noutcome could raise the risk of tenants either breaking or not \nrenewing leases, which may negatively impact investors\u2019 cash \nflows  All told, the AI opportunity for credit investors should \nrise alongside the industry\u2019s growing reliance on debt financing, \nthough it will come with risks    \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n2018 2019 2020 2021

\nand opportunities facing the venture capital market globally and in key \njurisdictions around the world \nAgainst a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty and renewed concerns \nover tariffs and trade tensions, global VC investment rose from\n$118 billion in Q4\u201924 to $126 billion in Q1\u201925, fueled by a wave of \nmegadeals \u2014 including eight $1 billion+ transactions and a standout \n$40 billion raise by OpenAI \nDespite the uptick in investment value, deal volume declined quarter-\nover-quarter as many VC investors paused to evaluate whether \nmarket shifts were temporary and to preserve capital in light of \nongoing IPO exit delays  The US accounted for the bulk of this investment, \nincluding a $40 billion standout deal by OpenAI, a $4 5 billion raise by \nAnthropic (two closings) and a $3 billion raise by Infinite Reality  VC \ninvestment in Europe remained flat quarter-over-quarter at $18 billion, \nled by a massive $2 billion deal by cryptocurrency exchange Binance, \nfollowed by Germany-based energy management proptech Reneo \n($624 million) and UK-based AI drug discovery firm Isomorphic Labs \n($600 million)  Singapore-based data center firm \nDayOne raised the largest VC deal ($1  \nAI remained the hottest ticket globally  In addition to large raises by \nLLM-focused companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, companies \nfocused on AI applications (e \nvehicles, robotics) and industry solutions \u2014 such as AI for mining tech \ncompany Kobold Metals ($537 million) and AI preventative health \ncompany Cera ($150 million)\u2014also saw significant investments  \nDefense Tech and spacetech also continued to gain traction with VC \ninvestors \nWhile there had been optimism that Q1\u201925 could mark a rebound in IPO \nactivity in the US, lingering market uncertainties led many startups to \ndelay their public debut plans  US-based AI infrastructure firm \nCoreWeave went public late in the quarter, though its relatively muted \nperformance \u2014 and unique business model\u2014meant it wasn\u2019t seen as a \nreliable indicator for broader IPO sentiment  Sweden-based fintech \nKlarna had initially signaled plans for a Q1 IPO but ultimately postponed \nthe offering  Its performance, should the IPO proceed in Q2, will be \nclosely watched as a potential bellwether for other late-stage tech \ncompanies considering the public markets  \nThe current levels of geopolitical uncertainty will likely continue to affect \nthe VC market heading into Q2\u201925, although areas like AI, defense tech, \ncybersecurity, and alternative energy will likely remain resilient \nIn this quarter\u2019s edition of Venture Pulse, we examine these and a \nnumber of other global and regional trends, including:\n\u2022 The increasing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties\n\u2022 The expanding diversity of AI solutions attracting investments\n\u2022 The growing attention being given to defense tech and spacetech\n\u2022 The increasing involvement of governments in driving AI investments\nWe hope you find this edition of Venture Pulse insightful  If you would \nlike to discuss any of the results in

globally increased between Q4\u201924 and Q1\u201925, driven in part by a large number of $1 billion+ megadeals, including a standout investment of $40 billion in OpenAI  \nUS att ract s over two-thirds of VC funding globally in Q1\u201925\nVC investment in the Americas surged in Q1 2025, driven by a series of megadeals, while Europe \nsaw more muted growth and Asia experienced another quarterly decline, reaching record low \ninvestment levels  Deal volume dropped across all regions, as investors remained cautious amid \nmacroeconomic uncertainty   \nThe US retained its position as the top destination for VC funding, bolstered by several high-profile \nraises, i\nncluding OpenAI\u2019s $40 billion raise, Anthropic\u2019s $4 5 billion raise (two closings), and Infinite \nReality\u2019s $3 \nbillion raise in the augmented reality space  Europe ranked second in total VC \ninvestment, led by Binance\u2019s $2 billion raise \u2014 the region\u2019s  largest of the quarter \u2014 followed by \nGerman proptech firm Reneo, which secured $624 million  Asia\u2019s VC market remained soft, with just \nthree deals ex\nceeding$500 million 2 billion \nraise, followed by China\u2019s cleantech company SE Environmental ($688 million) and India-based \ne-commerce platform Meesho ($550 million) \nHot AI space attracting diversity of deals across jurisdictions\nAI plays continued to dominate the VC market in Q1\u201925  While the largest deals in the AI sector \noccurred \nin the US led, by OpenAI, Anthropic and Infinite Reality, other regions also saw robust AI \ninvestments  In Europe, AI-enabled industry solutions companies raised a number of $100 million \nfunding \nrounds, including Sweden-based preventative healthtech company Neko Health ($260 million) \nand UK-based AI\n-powered video communications company Synthesia ($180 million)  Asia also saw a \nnumber \nof significant AI-focused raises, including China-based Neolix Technologies ($137 million) and \nUnivista ($137 million), Australia-based Harrison ai ($111 million), Hong Kong (SAR) and Boston-\nbased InSilico Medicine ($100 million), and India-based Spotdraft ($54 million)

com/world/china/china-set-up-national-venture-capital-guidance-fund-state -planner-says-2025-03 -06/\nLooking at\n the AI space more broadly, the launch of China-based DeepSeek\u2019s R1 AI model sent \nripples across the globe in Q1\u201925  DeepSeek\u2019s launch was followed closely by new AI models by \nChinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba  The launch of the three models so close together \u2014 all \npurporting to be more energy efficient than others built to date \u2014 highlights the intense competition \nglobally and regionally for market dominance in the large language model (LLM) space \nGeopolitical uncertainties and tensions driving VC investment into defense tech \nand spacetech\nAs competition heated up in the AI space worldwide, a number of governments made substantive \nmoves in order to promote, encourage, and accelerate AI development  During the quarter, the US \nannounced The Stargate Project, which aims to spend $500 billion on developing next-gen AI \ninfrastructure in the US \n1 This was followed by the European Commission\u2019s announcement of its \nInvestAI program2  \u2014 a plan to drive $206 billion into AI innovation, including the development of \ngigafactories \u2014 and France\u2019s announcement of $112 billion in AI investment commitments 3 During the \nquarter, China also announced a $138 billion national venture capital guidance fund to invest in a \nrange of priority sectors, including AI and quantum computing  The US \nsaw the largest defense tech deals during the quarter, including a $600 million raise by Saronic \nTechnologies, a $240 million raise by ShieldAI, and a $250 million raise by Epirus  Japan in particular saw several deals during the quarter, \nincluding raises by ArkEdge Space ($51 million) and Interstellar Technologies ($45 million) \nGlobal VC investment falters amid fresh wave of uncertainty , cont\u2019 d \nIPO market in US sees another setback amid new \ngeopolitical uncertainties; HKSE sees some recovery\nThe hopeful optimism that characterized thoughts on the IPO market \nglobally at the end of Q4\u201924 did not materialize in Q1\u201925  Concerns about \ntariffs and trade wars rose to the forefront of concerns, causing challenges \nac\nross a number of stock markets globally, which likely contributed to \ncaution on the part of IPO-ready companies  Late in the quarter, AI \ninfrastructure firm CoreWeave held its IPO, although the company\u2019s \nrelatively lackadaisical results were not expected to spur additional market \nactivity  Sweden-based Klarna filed for an IPO during the quarter, but the \noffering was put on hold following a wave of market volatility triggered by \nthe US administration\u2019s tariff announcements \nHong Kong (SAR), China\u2019s IPO market got off to a relatively strong start in \n2025, driven in part by the successful IPO of China-based bubble tea \ncompany Mixue  Given the challenges in the US, the HKSE appeared to \nbenefit from Asia-based investors shifting their focus back to the Hong \nKong (SAR), China market during the quarter \nA lternative energy and cleantech continue to see \ninvestment \nAlternative energy and cleantech remained attractive areas of \ninvestment in many regions of the world during Q1\u201925, with a range \nof companies attracting investments  During the \nquarter, nuclear energy-focused X Energy raised $700 million, and \nnuclear fission company Helion raised $425 million  \nIn Europe and Asia, investments were more diverse, ranging from \nGermany-based real estate energy management company Reneo\u2019s \n$624 million raise to Sweden-based long-term energy contracts \nfirm Elvy\u2019s $153 million raise, and from China-based smart EV \nmaker Changan Kaicheng\u2019s $274 million funding round to Australia-\nbased sustainable vertical farming company Stacked Farm\u2019s \n$150 million raise  \nTrends to watch for in Q2\u201925\nHeading into Q2\u201925, AI is expected to remain the \nprimary driver of VC investment globally  \nIndustry-focused AI solutions are likely to attract \ngrowing interest, alongside advanced robotics \nand enabling technologies such as LIDAR \nHowever, VC investment may begin the quarter \non a slower note as investors await greater clarity \non the escalating global trade war and its \npotential economic ramifications  Global M&A \nactivity could accelerate in Q2\u201925 and beyond, \nparticularly in the AI space, as major tech \ncompanies seek to acquire promising startups \nbefore valuations rise further  In the \nface of continued IPO uncertainty, M&A remains \na compelling alternative for companies seeking \nstrategic exits

it\u2019s strongest quarter of VC investment in several \nyears in Q1\u201925, driven primarily by large megadeals, including a\n$125 million raise by AI-powered productivity software company \nTines, a $120 million raise by medical device company Fire1, and a \n$120 million raise by ocean data services company Xocean  Fintech \nand medtech sectors in Ireland continue to attract significant interest \nfrom VC investors given their robust innovation ecosystems and \nstrong talent base, with AI solutions also receiving significant \ninvestment over the quarter  While positive coming into 2025, the \nsentiment of VC investors in Ireland was one of caution in the latter \nhalf of Q1\u201925 amid rising geopolitical uncertainties  The growing \nuncertainty could impact VC investment heading into 2025 \nGlobal | US | Americas  Europe Asia\nTrends to watch for in Q2\u201925\nHeading into Q2\u201925, deal volume will likely \nremain subdued as investors in Europe \nremain very cautious amid trade tensions \nwith the US  The implications associated \nwith any US tariffs could be significant; \nboth investors and startups are expected \nto be quite focused on assessing potential \nimpacts on both general operations and \npotential cross-border expansion plans  \nDespite these uncertainties, areas like AI, \ndefense tech, and cleantech will likely \ncontinue to

amid regional headwinds\nBoth venture capital investment and deal volume declined in Asia during Q1 2025, with the region raising just $12 9 billion across 2,149 deals \u2014 reflecting continued softness in the market  \nThe downturn was largely driven by persistent challenges in China, including economic uncertainty and ongoing real estate sector issues, as well as heightened investor caution in India, \namid broader geopolitical tensions 2 billion raise by data center company DayOne, which significantly \nboosted the country\u2019s quarterly totals \nAI space sees a lot of excitement in Asia during Q1\u201925, particularly in China\nThe AI space in Asia attracted a significant amount of attention in Q1\u201925, driven by the launch of China-based \nDeepSeek\u2019s R1 model  This was seen as a major win for China\u2019s AI sector, given the expectation that access \nto DeepSeek\u2019s open source model will help a lot of AI application companies further advance their own \nmodels and AI-driven solutions  During the quarter, two Chinese tech giants also launched major AI \nofferings \u2014 including Tencent, which launched the T1 reasoning model,14 and Alibaba, which released the \nQwen 2  This feverish level of activity highlights the highly competitive nature of \nthe space and the quest for dominant market position 15\nIPO market in Hong Kong (SAR), China shows strength in Q1\u201925\nThe IPO market and stock exchanges in Hong Kong (SAR), China got off to a strong start in Q1\u201925  During Q1\u201925, Hong Kong also enhanced its\nefforts to market the HKSE as a place for IPO fundraising within other jurisdictions, including Saudi \nArabia and Japan  Following on trends seen\n \nin recent quarters, much of the VC investment in China during Q1\u201925 occurred in areas considered to be \nmajor government priorities, including hard technologies, new energy, electric vehicles, and AI  \nCleantech company SE Environmental raised the largest deal in China during the quarter ($688 million) \nfollowed by new energy vehicle company Changan Kaicheng ($274 million), AI-powered autonomous \nvan company Neolix Technologies ($137 million), electronic design automation company Univista \n($137 million), and chip manufacturer InventChip Technology ($136 million)  Tis likely reflects a desire to invest in companies \nearly in order to leverage the growth when their technologies are ready to be monetized in the market  \nVC investment dips slightly in India as investors taking a wait-and-see approach to \nuncertainty\nIndia saw VC investment drop slightly in Q1\u201925 as investors held back from making major investments \ngiven the rapidly evolving geopolitical situation  Capital markets also took a beating in India during the \nquarter amid concerns of overpricing  While markets recovered somewhat in the second half of Q1\u201925, \nthe general trajectory was lower than initially expected in Q4\u201924  \nE-commerce and quick commerce big winners in India in Q1\u201925\nVC investors in India remained highly focused on consumer offerings in Q1\u201925, with areas such as\ne-commerce and quick commerce attracting the most significant attention; during the quarter social\ne-commerce platform Meesho raised $550 million  Payments and lending also continued to be a key\nsector of investment in India,

investment in Japan remained relatively strong in Q1 2025, reaching \n$902 million across 290 deals, compared to $1  That said, the market faced headwinds, including \nongoing softness in IPO activity, which limited perceived exit opportunities \nand dampened expectations for VC fund performance \nGovernment support for spacetech development in Japan\nIn Japan, AI, DeepTech and SpaceTech attracted the most attention from \nVC investors in Q1\u201925, in addition to drug discovery, ESG-related solutions, \nand SaaS IT solutions  Spacetech was particularly notable given the $51 \nmillion raise by microsatellite company ArkEdge Space and the $44 million \nraise by space transportation and satellite development company \nInterstellar Technologies  Government support for the space satellite \nsector, the ready availability of rocket launch locations in the country, and \nthe expectation that Japan will increase its space-related defense budget \nwill likely keep SpaceTech a hot area of innovation and investment heading \ninto Q2\u201925  This \ntrend shifted in Q1\u201925, in part because of the growth in licensing-out \ntrends, which have led to developments in

transactions that are tracked as \nprivate equity growth by PitchBook  The key difference is that PitchBook defines a PE growth round as a \nfinancial investment occurring when a PE investor acquires a minority stake in a privately held corporation  Thus, if the investor is \nclassified as PE by PitchBook, and it is the sole participant in the recipient company\u2019s financing, then such a round will usually be \nclassified as PE growth, and not included in the Venture Pulse datasets  However, as of the Q4 2022 edition, a new stage for \nventure that was invented by PitchBook to account for growth at late-stage VC will be included, defined as venture growth  Otherwise, the \nfollowing industries are excluded from growth equity financing calculations: buildings and property, thrifts and mortgage finance, \nreal estate investment trusts, and oil & gas equipment, utilities, exploration, production and refining \nFundraising\nPitchBook defines VC funds as pools of capital raised for the purpose of investing in the equity of startup companies  In \naddition to funds raised by traditional VC firms, PitchBook also includes funds raised by any institution with the primary \nintent stated above  Funds identifying as growthstage vehicles are classified as PE funds and are not included in this \nreport  Only funds based in the United States that have \nheld their final close are included in the fundraising numbers \nPre-seed/seed: The pre-seed stage encompasses a collection of emergent startups receiving the first check from at least \none institutional investor to fuel their development growth \n\u2022 Early-stage: Rounds are generally classified as Series A or B (which we typically aggregate together as early-stage) \neither by the series of stock issued in the financing or, if that information is unavailable, by a series of factors \nincluding: the age of the company, prior financing history, company status, participating investors, and more  \n\u2022 Late-stage: Rounds are generally classified as Series C or D or later (which we typically aggregate together as \nlate-stage) either by the series of stock issued in the financing or, if that information is unavailable, by a series of \nfactors including: the age of the company, prior financing history, company status, participating investors, and more  \n\u2022 Growth: Financings tagged as Series E or later or deals involving companies that are at least seven years old and \nhave raised at least six VC rounds will be included in this category, as of the Q4 2022 edition of Venture Pulse \nreleased in January 2023  This \nincludes events where there is a public market for the shares (IPO) or the acquisition of majority of the equity by another \nentity (corporate or financial acquisition)  One slight methodology update is the categorical change from \u201cIPO\u201d to \u201cpublic listings\u201d to accommodate \nthe different ways we track VC-backed companies\u2019 transitions to the public markets  This has led to a significant change in aggregate exit values in all subsequent \neditions yet is more reflective of how the industry views the true size of an exit via public markets

Increased consumer demand\nEventually, the GDP uplift from product \nenhancements and subsequent shifts in consumer \ndemand, behaviour and consumption emanating \nfrom AI will overtake the productivity gains, \npotentially delivering more than $9 trillion \nof additional GDP in 2030  \nThe consumer revolution set off by AI opens the \nway for massive disruption as both established \nbusinesses and new entrants drive innovation \nand develop new business models  A key part \nof the impact of AI will come from its ability to \nmake the most of parallel developments such as \nIoT\u00a0connectivity2  \nAI front-runners will have the advantage of \nsuperior customer insight  The immediate \ncompetitive benefits include an improved ability \nto tap into consumer preferences, tailor their \noutput to match these individual demands and, \nin doing so, capture an ever bigger slice of the \nmarket  And the front-runners\u2019 ability to shape \nproduct developments around this rich supply of \ncustomer data will make it harder and harder for \nslower moving competitors to keep pace and could \neventually make their advantage unassailable  \nWe can already see this data-driven innovation \nand differentiation in the way books, music, video \nand entertainment are produced, distributed and \nconsumed, resulting in new business models, new \nmarket leaders and the elimination of traditional \nplayers that fail to adapt quickly enough  \nHealthcare, automotive and financial services are \nthe sectors with the greatest potential for product \nenhancement and disruption due to AI according \nto our analysis  However, there is also significant \npotential for competitive advantage in particular \nareas of other sectors, ranging from on-demand \nmanufacturing to sharper content targeting \nwithin entertainment we set out the business \nareas with most AI potential in each sector in the \nnext section  \nSome job displacement \u2013 but also new \nemployment opportunities\nThe adoption of \u2018no-human-in-the-loop\u2019 \ntechnologies will mean that some posts will \ninevitably become redundant, but others will be \ncreated by the shifts in productivity and consumer \ndemand emanating from AI, and through the \nvalue chain of AI itself  In addition to new types \nof workers who will focus on thinking creatively \nabout how AI can be developed and applied, a \nnew set of personnel will be required to build, \nmaintain, operate, and regulate these emerging \ntechnologies  For example, we will need the \nequivalent of air traffic controllers to control \nthe autonomous vehicles on the road  All of this will facilitate the creation of \nnew jobs that would not have existed in a world \nwithout AI \nImpact on different regions\nAs Figure 2 highlights, some economies have \nthe potential to gain more than others in both \nabsolute and relative terms \n2  AI is the key to realising the promise of IoT as AI becomes an indispensable element of IoT solutions and the convergence of AI and IoT \nspur the development of \u2018smart\u2019 machines  We explore this further in \u2018Leveraging the

North America\nIn North America, the potential uplift to GDP from \nAI will be amplified by the huge opportunities to \nintroduce more productive technologies, many \nof which are ready to be applied  And the gains \nwill be accelerated by the advanced technological \nand consumer readiness for AI, along with the \nimpact of rapid accumulation of assets \u2013 not just \ntechnology, but data touchpoints and the flows \nof\u00a0information and customer insight that come \nwith them  \nOne of the main reasons is that as productivity \nin China begins to catch up with North America, \nthis will stimulate exports of AI-enabled products \nfrom China to North America  But in \naround ten years\u2019 time, the productivity gains in \nChina could begin to pull ahead \nA key part of the value potential comes from the \nhigher rate of capital re-investment within the \nChinese economy compared to Europe and North \nAmerica, as profits from Chinese businesses are \nfed into increasing AI capabilities and returns  \nAI will also play an important part in the shift to \na more consumer-oriented economy on the one \nhand and the move up the value chain into more \nsophisticated and high tech-driven manufacturing \nand commerce on the other  The focus and \ninvestment are amply demonstrated by the surge \nin AI patents filed in China 3  An acceleration in \ntalent development in areas such as analytics will \nbe crucial in realising the potential gains from AI \nwithin the Chinese economy \n3  China is now second behind the US in AI patent filings, a key indicator of long-term trends in technology org/blog-post/the-\nglobal-race-for-artificial-intelligence-comparison-patenting-trends) \nCritical assumptions\nOur estimates reflect certain assumptions, which we will stress-test \nin our forthcoming detailed economic assessment  What happens if \nthe pace of AI adoption is faster/slower in particular countries, for \nexample? How does that affect the distribution of global growth? What \nhappens if estimated changes in product quality do not materialise? A \nslowdown in the pace of AI uptake would delay the benefits that feed \nthrough to labour productivity  We see this as a key driver to both the \ntiming and the overall impact of AI on GDP  This includes examining alternate combinations of input \nparameters, as well as the timing of AI uptake  These sensitivity tests \nare designed to help better understand the risks around our results, \nwhile providing more insight into the parameters that drive the \nrelationship between AI and economic growth  We plan to present the \nresults of several scenarios in our detailed economic assessment \n8\nSizing the prize Automation in action\nAn online insurer has leveraged an AI bot to automate the claims process \nfrom beginning to end  Instead of the days or even months it traditionally \ntook to settle a claim, the bot is able to complete the entire pipeline from \nclaims receipt, policy reference, fraud detection, payout and notification \nto customers in just three seconds \nHow to respond?\nIf your business is operating in one of the sectors \nor economies that is gearing up for fast adoption \nof AI, you\u2019ll have to move quickly if you want \nto capitalise on the openings, and ensure your \nbusiness doesn\u2019t lose out to faster-moving and more \ncost-efficient competitors \nIf you\u2019re in one of the sectors or economies where \nthe disruptive potential is lower and adoption \nlikely to be slower, there is still a significant \nchallenge ahead \u2013 no sector or business is in any \nway immune from the impact of AI  In fact, the \npotential for innovation and differentiation could \nbe all the greater because fewer market players are \ncurrently focusing on AI  It\u2019s easy to \ndismiss a lot of what\u2019s said about AI as hype  \nAre you in a position to move ahead of your \ncompetitors?

define the priority policy actions needed to maintain \nand strengthen America's dominance and leadership in artificial intelligence  In this submission, \nwe outline specific actions the administration should take to ensure that America maximally \nbenefits from the potential of advanced AI systems  government should make to cultivate a robust \nAI development and deployment ecosyst\nem that fosters American prosperity and ensures that \nAI-driven economic benefits are widely shared across society   \nPowerful AI technology will be built during this Administration  Given the rapid pace of \ndevelopment, it is imperative that this technology be treated as a critical national asset through \na targeted AI Act\nion Plan that strengthens American economic competitiveness while bolstering \nour national security  \nAbout Anthropic \nAnthropic is a leading frontier AI model developer working to build reliable, interpretable, and \nsteerable artificial intelligence systems  Our flagship AI assistant, Claude, represents the state \n1 \n of the art in Large Language Model (LLM) technology  government agencies to small businesses and consumers, \nuse Claude as an AI co-pilot to enhance productivity on sophisticated tasks including software \ndevelopment, data analysis, and scientific research 7 \nSonnet, which is by many performance benchmarks the most powerful and capable \ncommercially-available AI system in the world  \nWhat we mean by \u201cpowerful AI\u201d \nWhen we discuss \u201cpowerful AI\u201d, we are referring to systems that represent a major \nadvancement beyond today\u2019s AI model capabilities  Powerful AI systems will have the following \nproperties: \n\u25cf Intellectual capabilities matching or exceeding that of Nobel Prize winners across most\ndisciplines\u2014including biology, computer science, mathematics, and engineering \n\u25cf The ability to navigate all interfaces available to a human doing digital work today,\nincluding the ability to process and generate text, audio, and video, the ability to\nautonomously control technology instruments like mice and keyboards, and the ability to\naccess and browse the internet \nA useful conceptual framework is to envision powerful AI as equivalent to \u201ca country of \ngeniuses in a datacenter\u201d\u2014a concentration of intellectual capability that fundamentally \ntransforms our understanding of what is possible  \nBased on current research trajectories, we anticipate that powerful AI systems could emerge as \nsoon as late 2026 or 2027 1 \nTaking the opportunities and risks of powerful AI seriously \nWe expect that the economic and national security implications of this technology will be \ntremendous  2024), available at: \nhttps://darioamodei  First, it must \nstrengthen national security frameworks both during the critical development phase of powerful \nAI and in the new technological landscape that emerges afterward  Second, it must pursue \npolicies that enable these systems to generate broad-based American prosperity, ensuring that \nproductivity gains and new capabilities benefit citizens across all segments of society  \nEnhancing American National Security \nBuild the federal government\u2019s capacity to test and evaluate powerful AI models \nfor national security capabilities \nAs artificial intelligence systems grow increasingly sophisticated, they will present significant \nnational security implications\u2014on one hand, potentially enabling adversaries to pursue harmful \nobjectives; on the other, providing the United States with strategic advantages when properly \nleveraged  To optimize national security outcomes, the federal government must develop \nrobust capabilities to rapidly assess any powerful AI system, foreign or domestic, for \npotential national security uses and misuses  \nWe anticipate dramatic capability advancements in frontier AI models over the next 2-4 years, \nparticularly in domains with significant security implications including biological weapon and \ncybersecurity risks 2 Ultimately, we believe if there is evidence that AI systems pose critical \nnational security risks then developers like Anthropic should be required3 to test their systems \nfor these risks\u2014but to be able to make that decision, we must first equip the U  AI Safety and Security Institutes 5 This \ntrajectory suggests, consistent with scaling laws research, that numerous AI systems will \nincreasingly embody significant national security implications in the coming years  20, 2024), available at: https://www  24, 2025), available at: \nhttps://assets , \u201cInternational AI Safety Report\u201d (January 2025), available at: \nhttps://assets

build powerful dual-use AI systems  \nThe critical importance of robust evaluation capabilities was highlighted by the release of \nDeepSeek R1\u2014a Chinese AI model freely distributed online\u2014earlier this year  \nTo establish effective government testing and evaluation for capabilities of powerful AI systems, \nthe administration should: \n\u25cf Preserve the AI Safety Institute in the Department of Commerce and build on the MOUs\nit has signed with U  AI companies\u2014including Anthropic\u2014to advance the state of the\nart in third-party testing of AI systems for national security risks \n\u25cf Direct the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST), in consultation with\nthe Intelligence Community, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security,\nand other relevant agencies, to develop comprehensive national security evaluations for\npowerful AI models, in partnership with frontier AI developers, and develop a protocol for\nsystematically testing powerful AI models for these vulnerabilities \n\u25cf Ensure that the federal government has access to the classified cloud and on-premises\ncomputing infrastructure needed to conduct thorough evaluations of powerful AI models \n\u25cf Build a team of interdisciplinary professionals within the federal government with national\nsecurity knowledge and technical AI expertise to analyze potential security vulnerabilities\nand assess deployed systems  AI lead \nExport controls on semiconductors, semiconductor tooling, and certain model weights represent \ncritical policy instruments that will slow adversarial development of powerful AI and enable the \nUnited States to maintain a durable lead in frontier AI development  The semiconductor \nrestrictions initiated during President Trump\u2019s first term and subsequently enhanced have \neffectively constrained asymmetric state competitors from achieving significant advances in AI \ndevelopment capabilities   \nTo prevent advanced AI models and AI infrastructure from being acquired by adversaries, we \nstrongly recommend the administration strengthen export controls on computational \nresources and implement appropriate export restrictions on certain model weights  Current export controls do not apply to the H20, a\nhigh-memory chip introduced in 2024 for sale to China that can be used to train and run\npowerful models  While these chips underperform H100s for initial training, they excel at\ntext generation (\u201csampling\u201d)\u2014a fundamental component of advanced reinforcement\nlearning methodologies critical to current frontier model capability advancements  The Department of Commerce\u2019s January 2025 Interim\nFinal Rule on the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion (the \u201cDiffusion Rule\u201d)\nalready contains the possibility for such agreements, laying a foundation for further\npolicy development  These orders do not count\nagainst the Rule\u2019s caps, regardless of the purchaser  Determining\nthe optimal lower threshold would require comprehensive analysis balancing smuggling\nprevention against commercial facilitation  frontier labs \nAs discussed earlier, the next generations of powerful AI models will be highly capable and \neconomically valuable, and thus prime targets for misuse and abuse by bad actors  Today\u2019s \nindividual AI systems already command valuations in the high billions of dollars, making them \nattractive targets for sophisticated threat actors  Moreover, these AI systems represent the \nproduct of computational resources that have been strategically denied to certain nations \nthrough export controls, doubling their appeal as valuable theft targets  To mitigate these risks, the federal government should \npartner with industry leaders to substantially enhance security protocols at frontier AI \nlaboratories to prevent adversarial misuse and abuse of powerful AI technologies   \nTo achieve this, we strongly recommend the Administration: \n\u25cf Establish classified and unclassified communication channels between American frontier\nAI laboratories and the Intelligence Community for threat intelligence sharing, similar to\nInformation Sharing and Analysis Centers used in critical infrastructure sectors \n\u25cf Create systematic collaboration between frontier AI companies and the Intelligence\nCommunity agencies, including Five Eyes partners, to monitor adversary capabilities \n\u25cf Elevate collection and analysis of adversarial AI development to a top intelligence\npriority, as to provide strategic warning and support export controls \n\u25cf Expedite security clearances for industry professionals to aid collaboration \n\u25cf Direct NIST to develop next-generation cyber and physical security standards specific to\nAI training and inference clusters \nBy implementing this comprehensive security framework, the federal government will \nsubstantially strengthen the defensive posture of American AI companies, and significantly \nimpede the ability of bad actors to misappropriate cutting-edge American technology and \nweaponize it against U  We project that by 2027, training a single frontier AI model will require networked \ncomputing clusters drawing approximately five gigawatts of power  When multiplied across all \nleading AI developers, the United States will need to deploy tens of additional gigawatts of \nenergy capacity within the next three years to maintain its competitive edge and support AI \nmodel development at home  Furthermore, beyond the energy to train AI models, substantial \npower will be needed to operate inference clusters that deploy these models for applications \nthroughout business, government, and society  \n6 \n The federal government should consider establishing an ambitious national target: build 50 \nadditional gigawatts of power dedicated to the AI industry by 2027 \nFailing to address these energy requirements presents serious risks to America\u2019s technological \nleadership, as U  AI developers may be forced to relocate operations overseas or postpone \ncrucial R&D activities until sufficient domestic capacity becomes available  This scenario could \neffectively transfer the infrastructure foundation of our AI economy to foreign competitors and \nrisk that the world\u2019s leading AI technology will not represent American values  Indeed, some \nauthoritarian regimes who do not share our country\u2019s democratic values and may pose security \nthreats are already actively courting American AI companies with promises of abundant, \nlow-cost energy  developers migrate model development or storing of model weights to \nthese countries in order to access these energy sources, this could expose sensitive intellectual \nproperty to transfer or theft, enable the creation of AI systems without proper security protocols, \nand potentially subject valuable AI assets to disruption or coercion by foreign powers  \nPromoting rapid AI procurement across the federal government \nOne of AI's most transformative impacts will be revolutionizing government operations\u2014both in \ndelivering benefits to Americans and in supporting U  We propose an ambitious initiative: across the whole of \ngovernment, the Administration should systematically identify every instance where \nfederal employees process text, images, audio, or video data, and augment these \nworkflows with appropriate AI systems , Hannah Jo Uy, \u201cHow the

government worker with an AI-powered \nassistant, dramatically increasing productivity and effectiveness  Starting by conducting a \ncomprehensive inventory and initial implementation processes will naturally reveal the \ninstitutional barriers currently impeding effective AI adoption across federal agencies  \nTo execute this vision, the Administration should pursue several key actions: \n\u25cf The White House should task the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to work with\nCongress to rapidly address resource constraints, procurement limitations, and\nprogrammatic obstacles to federal AI adoption, incorporating provisions for substantial AI\nacquisitions in the President\u2019s Budget \n\u25cf Coordinate a cross-agency effort to identify and eliminate regulatory and procedural\nbarriers to rapid AI deployment at the federal agencies, for both civilian and national\nsecurity applications \n\u25cf Direct the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community to use the full extent\nof their existing authorities to accelerate AI research, development, and procurement \n\u25cf Identify the largest programs in civilian agencies where AI automation or augmentation\ncan deliver the most significant and tangible public benefits\u2014such as streamlining tax\nprocessing at the Internal Revenue Service, enhancing healthcare delivery at the\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, reducing delays due to documentation processing at\nHealth and Human Services, or reducing backlogs at the Social Security Administration \nWe also encourage the White House to leverage existing frameworks to enhance federal \nprocurement for national security purposes, particularly the directives in the October 2024 \nNational Security Memorandum (NSM) on Artificial Intelligence and the accompanying \nFramework to Advance AI Governance and Risk Management in National Security  These \nframeworks enable piloting frontier AI applications in government and the development of robust \ntesting and evaluation capabilities to build confidence in these systems  \nAdditionally, we strongly advocate for the creation of a joint working group between the \nDepartment of Defense and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to develop \nrecommendations for the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FARC) on accelerating \nprocurement processes for AI systems while maintaining rigorous security and reliability \nstandards  The FARC should then consider appropriate amendments to the Federal Acquisition \nRegulation based on these recommendations to create a procurement environment that \nbalances innovation with responsible governance  \nMonitoring the economic impacts of AI and preparing for major actions \nTechnology equivalent to a \u201ccountry of geniuses inside a datacenter\u201d will fundamentally \ntransform our economy  In February, we launched the Anthropic \nEconomic Index in February, an initiative designed to assess AI's impact on labor markets by \ncorrelating our usage data with the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) O*NET framework 7  While \nacknowledging the inherent limitations of our dataset and methodology, this approach provides \nautomated, granular insights into AI's evolving economic role and identifies early indicators of \nfuture impacts as these systems advance in capability  We anticipate that 2025 will likely mark \nthe beginning of more visible, large-scale economic effects from AI technologies  \nThe Administration can enhance governmental data collection mechanisms to better capture AI \nadoption patterns and economic implications and prepare for the possibility of significant change \nby exploring the following ideas: \n\u25cf The Census Bureau\u2019s American Time Use Survey should incorporate specific questions\nabout AI usage, distinguishing between personal and professional applications while\ngathering detailed information about task types and systems employed \n\u25cf The Census Bureau\u2019s Annual Business Survey should include more detailed questions\nabout the types of AI technology used by businesses, along with the tasks performed by\nor with the assistance of AI technologies, while also disaggregating between LLMs and\nother forms of AI products \n\u25cf We believe that computing power will become an increasingly significant driver of\neconomic growth  Accordingly, the White House should track the relationship between\ninvestments in AI computational resources and economic performance to inform\nstrategic investments in domestic infrastructure and related supply chains \n\u25cf The White House should engage with Congress on and task relevant agencies with\nexamining how AI adoption might reshape the composition of the national tax base, and\nensure the government maintains visibility into potential structural economic shifts \nThis forward-looking approach to understanding the economic transition that AI will bring will \nhelp ensure the benefits of technological advancement are broadly shared across American \nsociety  10, 2025), available at: \nhttps://www  \n9 \n Conclusion \nWe believe that extremely powerful AI technology will be developed during this Administration  \nPresident Trump and this Administration have a tremendous opportunity to enable American \ndominance in AI by unlocking the benefits of this technology and ensuring that America remains \ndominant over China and our other adversaries  \nThroughout this submission we have advocated for the federal government to have access to \nbetter and more information about the national security and economic impacts of AI, as well as \nthe security practices of the AI companies themselves  We believe it is essential that this \nadministration finds ways to encourage AI companies to share more information about how they \ndevelop and test their models, along with the security practices they use to prevent them being \nstolen  The more we can encourage companies to arrive at a common standard of information \ndisclosure, the easier it will be for the federal government to have the information it needs to \ntackle the next few years\u2014years which we believe will be pivotal for AI development  By acting decisively now, we can position the \nUnited States to lead in this technological revolution, while maintaining the security essential to \nour national interests"

verticals has grown rapidly over the past decade  AI & ML \napplications are evolving rapidly, with the deployment of ChatGPT and DALL -E \nmodels driving increased interest in the space  Generative AI models joined the \nlexicon and created significant hype surrounding the technology and its ability to \nimprove productivity  \nVenture capital (VC) far outpaces private equity (PE) investment in the space and \nhas a more consistent track record with AI & ML technology, with $19  PE \ndealmakers are waiting as technologies mature and use cases are refined  Notable \nareas of IT investment beyond pure-play AI & ML include cybersecurity, which \nwill have increasing overlap with AI & ML as its applications expand and potential \nvulnerabilities are exposed  The mission-critical nature of cybersecurity \ncapabilities can justify larger deal sizes and continued deal flow even in a slower \nmarket \nSo-called Big Tech companies, defined in this dataset as technology companies \nlisted on the NASDAQ 100, ramped up their AI & ML acquisitions since 2019, with \na blockbuster year in 2021, during which several large acquisitions contributed to \n$20 0 billion dollar bet on OpenAI isn\u2019t Big Tech\u2019s first foray into AI, but \nit jump-started markets\u2019 focus on its capabilities and wide range of applications  \nOther tech giants seeking to enter the space through acquisitions in AI include \nAlphabet, Apple, and Meta  \nNotable risks include cybersecurity vulnerabilities, intellectual property disputes, \nand the need for massive computing power to run AI systems  These factors \ncreate an uncertain regulatory approach, which will require legal disputes to settle  \n\u201cWhile AI and other machine learning models \nhave been growing in popularity and use over the \nlast several years, ChatGPT popularized the use \nof AI among average internet users  We have just \nscratched the surface on what AI can do and what \nbusiness models it will disrupt as the technology \nmatures and continues to gain broader adoption \u201d\n\u2013 Bryan Schader, Partner, Cybersecurity Risk & IT Services\n03MOSS ADAMS  AI Industry Trends  /  Executive Summary \n SECTION THREE\nIndustry Trends \nCURRENT STATE OF THE TECHNOLOGY\nAI is inescapable in today\u2019s technology discussions  The following brief history was provided verbatim by ChatGPT \nusing the prompt, \u201cExplain the history of AI in 75 words or fewer \u201d \nAI emerged in the 1950s when John McCarthy coined the term  Early efforts \naimed to replicate human intelligence, but progress was limited  In the 2010s, \nbreakthroughs in deep learning and neural networks reinvigorated AI, leading \nto significant advancements in areas like computer vision and natural language \nprocessing  Today, AI is transforming industries with applications in autonomous \nvehicles, smart assistants, and more \nThe NLP showcased above is one highlight of recent AI development  NLP falls \nunder the umbrella of generative AI, which refers to models that generate forms of \nmedia in response to prompts by recognizing patterns in its input data \nOther areas of recent AI development include synthetic data, which is used in large \nquantities as input to train generative models, and accelerated computing, or the \nuse of specialized hardware to speed up processing and offload tedious computing \ntasks  \nDemand for computing power to support generative AI models is expected to grow \nexponentially as their use rises \nThe presence of chatbots and aspirational AI integrations has swelled, and markets \nlook to filter out the noise and identify the strongest applications  There will \ninevitably be winners and losers in the race to integrate AI  \nBoth consumer and enterprise applications for these technologies took off with \nexponentially greater attention paid by public and private markets  VCs led \nearly private investment with a greater appetite for speculative and frontier \ntechnologies, but as AI companies mature and use cases expand, PE firms and M&A \ndealmakers are taking notice \nThe recent wave of interest in AI has drawn comparisons to the levels of \ninvestment and excitement that surrounded cryptocurrency\u2014the total market \n04MOSS ADAMS  AI Industry Trends  /  Industry Trends \n capitalization of which peaked in 2021 and since dropped precipitously in what \nmany refer to as a crypto winter \nSome investors are still recovering from this descent as crypto platforms remain \nembroiled in legal proceedings, and they might take a more tempered approach \nto this next wave of technology  Despite this hesitation, markets more broadly are \neager to invest in AI, and this is providing cash windfalls for AI-related ventures  \nCybersecurity remains a priority\u2014particularly regarding chatbots\u2019 ability to \nreplicate information in a way that can be exploited by bad actors for purposes \nincluding identity theft  \nGovernment response has varied, as with Italy\u2019s outright ban on ChatGPT which \nit later reversed, and the EU\u2019s proposed restrictions like the European AI \nAct  Dealmaking will require detailed due diligence for compliance, especially as \nregulatory restrictions evolve  Generative models use large \nquantities of data as inputs to mimic projects and create new content, thus raising \nthe question of copyright infringement regarding both training data inputs and \ngenerated outputs  \nOne concern raised in the Writers Guild of America (WGA)  strike is the regulation \nof AI usage in scriptwriting and source material  Ongoing disputes have yet to set \nprecedents for intellectual property law in relation to AI models, meaning legal \nrisks remain for investors  \nVENTURE

ago, AI was considered an experiment, handed off  \nto tech teams eager to explore its possibilities  Today , it\u2019s \nrewiring how businesses operate, solve challenges, and drive \ngrowth  Across every industry , teams are racing to tap into the \nvalue of large language models (LLMs), automation, and \nnext-generation intelligent tools as AI becomes an essential \npart of everyday work \nThe AI imperative\nTo better understand how organizations are navigating this shift as they move into \n2026, Crusoe partnered with MetaLab to survey and interview enterprise and \ndigital-native business (DNB) leaders on the front lines of ambitious AI imperatives \nThe findings paint a clear picture: teams are turning to AI to clear away friction \nand free up resources \u2014 not simply to do more with less, but to create space \nfor creativity and innovation to flourish  One respondent put it this way: \u201cAI will be \ncentral to our innovation strategy, helping us stay ahead of industry trends and \ndeliver cutting-edge solutions that differentiate us in the market \u201d\nBut this race to realize AI\u2019s promise is far from straightforward  Decision-makers in our research surface a \ncommon set of challenges:\n\u2022 Performance bottlenecks and downtime that erode confidence and slow AI \nproject delivery\n\u2022 Unpredictable and opaque costs that make it nearly impossible to scale \nresponsibly\n\u2022 Fragmented support and a lack of domain expertise, leaving organizations with \ngaps between ambition and execution\n\u2022 Limited control over critical infrastructure, making teams vulnerable\nThroughout this report, we examine these persistent barriers \u2014 and, more \nimportantly, explore strategies for overcoming them  \nInfrastructure as the new differentiator\nForward-looking teams are rethinking not just how they use AI, but also how they \nbuild it  They\u2019re finding a better way with infrastructure partners who can enable \nspeed and performance without compromising security, sustainability, or ease of \nuse  This is the shift Crusoe is pioneering: a vertically integrated approach, built from \nthe ground up for AI  This AI factory model vertically integrates energy, hardware, \ndata center, cloud, and managed AI services into a single, cohesive platform  It\u2019s a \nnew paradigm that accelerates value creation while aligning with the demands of \nboth today\u2019s business and the future well-being of people and the planet \nIf you\u2019re navigating AI initiatives, our research offers a roadmap \u2014 and a call to action  \nWe\u2019ll show how a new, purpose-built approach to AI infrastructure is enabling \norganizations to move faster, with greater control, to create measurable impact  Page

AI and what\u2019s actually \nbeing delivered  We\u2019re at an inflection \npoint as we look to the future of what AI \nwill enable  \nAcross nearly every sector, the conversation around AI  \nhas changed  Rather than asking where AI can add value, \nteams are now actively seeking ways to translate AI\u2019s potential \ninto real business results at scale and at speed  In practice, \nthis means deploying AI for fraud detection, predictive \nanalytics, intelligent document processing, supply chain \noptimization, customer service automation, personalized \nmarketing, and more  \nThis report

\nfuture of AI  Efficiency is a catalyst for innovation\n AI is being deployed first and foremost to drive operational efficiency  By clearing friction and \nfreeing up resources, AI is paving the way for fresh creativity, faster innovation \ncycles, and stronger business impact  Dependability, cost-effectiveness, and transparency are \nnon-negotiable\n Companies building AI e xpect their cloud providers to deliver reliable \nperformance, predictable costs, and transparency  Persistent gaps here limit \nbusiness value and stall AI progress  They\u2019re demanding more direct control over \ntheir AI infrastructure to minimize surprises, reduce risk, and ensure their \ngoals aren\u2019t limited by someone else\u2019s roadmap  The shift toward end-to-end \nintegration reflects a new expectation: infrastructure partners should clear \nhurdles and empower teams to bring their vision to life  Expert support fills knowledge gaps\n AI adoption is outpacing internal e xpertise  Adaptability and ease of use are requirements\n The growing complexity of AI and cloud environments is a weight on both \nbusine\nss and technical teams  Companies building AI want adaptable,  \neasy-to-use solutions that reduce the burden of integration, support a range \nof workflows, and make it simple for teams to deliver results at scale  Responsible AI and sustainability are rising

responsible AI and  \nsustainability are rising rapidly as decision criteria \u2014 especially \nfor digital-native businesses and ESG-driven organizations \nFor DNBs, \u201cresponsible AI practices\u201d ranked as the fifth \nmost important attribute when evaluating cloud providers \n(out of 15 total), while for enterprises, it ranked eighth  Many \nrespondents predict that as their AI

rising priorities\nA key aspect of this shift is transparency around energy sourcing  Increasingly, builders expect providers to clearly \ndemonstrate how AI workloads are powered, particularly with regard to renewable energy  Dissatisfaction is growing with \nvague or unsupported sustainability claims  As one leader put it: \u201cTo guarantee \nresponsible and ethical development and deployment of AI [solutions] at [our organization], we will always consider \nproviders\u2019 practices  Responsible AI practices are increasingly a \ntiebreaker \u2014 and, for some organizations, a

\nResponsible AI and sustainability may not be the first concern for \nevery organization today  But as expectations rise and the market \nmatures, leaders recognize that these values are fast becoming a \ndefining standard that will shape both competitive positioning and \nsocietal trust in the era of AI  Page 020\nAs organizations move from pilot projects to business-wide  \nAI integration, the question becomes how quickly and how \nsustainably teams can realize a competitive edge  \nSeizing the full potential of AI requires a new kind of \ninfrastructure partner \u2014 one built for the challenges and \nopportunities of this era  \nWhile legacy hyperscalers are working to adapt existing \ninfrastructure to meet AI\u2019s demands and many neoclouds are \nstruggling to deliver at scale, a new approach is needed  Every \nlayer of the stack must be designed specifically for AI workloads \nand optimized for the unique demands of generative models, \ndeep learning applications, and intelligent tools \nIn practice, vertical integration enables:\n\u2022 Direct oversight of performance and security: no more waiting on external \nvendors to resolve issues\n\u2022 Faster response to opportunity and change: your infrastructure can adapt as \nquickly as your strategy\n\u2022 Reduced risk: fewer points of failure and greater supply chain resilience\nMore than raw compute\nWhile access to compute power is critical, it is not, by itself, a differentiator  Our \nfindings show that speed to market \u2014 the ability to rapidly deploy, iterate, and \nscale \u2014 is the real advantage in today\u2019s environment  Modular, quickly deployable \ndata center solutions (such as Crusoe Spark\u2122) exemplify this shift: enabling \norganizations to expand capacity in weeks rather than months, giving teams the \nagility to seize AI opportunities as they emerge  \nSimplicity meets expertise to unlock possibilities  \nFor many organizations, the complexity of deploying and scaling AI has created \nexclusion rather than empowerment  Our research \nunderscores that reducing complexity and coupling technical depth with high-touch \nguidance are key to enabling broader participation and faster progress with AI  \nCommitment to responsible AI\nLeaders increasingly recognize that true progress in AI must be measured not only \nby technical achievement, but also by the broader consequences for people and \nthe planet  Decision-makers are asking tough questions about how their AI initiatives \naffect privacy, equity, and environmental stewardship  The organizations setting the \npace increasingly expect partners to:\n\u2022 Demonstrate clear ethical guidelines and guardrails for AI development and \ndeployment, reducing risks of bias, misuse, and unintended harm \n\u2022 Invest in sustainable operations and renewable energy to limit environmental \nfootprint and align technology growth with climate goals \n\u2022 Provide transparency and accountability in how data is sourced, how models \nare trained, and how decisions are made at every level \nAI will provide \nthe edge, and  \ninfrastructure \nwill decide  \nwho wins Page 021\nAI is now the defining force in business transformation  But building the future \nrequires a new foundation designed specifically for AI-powered innovation \nThe vision\nCrusoe is driven by a bold mission: to accelerate the abundance of energy and \nintelligence for a world hungry for progress  We see AI not just as a tool, but as a \ncatalyst for new opportunity, enabling organizations to turn ambitious ideas into \nreality \nThe Crusoe difference  \nWhat sets Crusoe apart is our AI factory model \u2014 a vertically integrated, energy-\nfirst, purpose-built approach to

    "content": "Grok 4 Model Card\nxAI\nLast updated: August 20, 2025\n1 Introduction\nGrok 4 is the latest reasoning model from xAI with advanced reasoning and tool-use capabilities,\nenabling it to achieve new state-of-the-art performance across challenging academic and industry\nbenchmarks  Because our models push the frontier of AI capabilities, we are committed to mitigating\ntheir risks through both evaluating model behaviors and implementing safeguards \nFollowing our Risk Management Framework (RMF), we aim to reduce the risk of severe, large-scale\nharms to people, property, and society from AI  For example, a hypothetical terrorist group using AI to help\nsynthesize chemical weapons would require models that possess advanced scientific knowledge,\nwhereas a hypothetical rogue AI exfiltrating its weights requires models that can manipulate humans\nand hack systems  xAI deploysGrok 4in both the consumer-facing\napplications (Grok 4 Web) and through an enterprise use-focused API (Grok 4 API)  We report\nevaluations forGrok 4 APIand Grok 4 Webnow available to our customers, including in the EU \nFinally, we describe our training pipeline (Section 3 , jailbreaks and prompt injections)  To achieve this,\nour main focus is on measuring and reducing the rate at whichGrok 4responds deceptively  While the general cyber knowledge and exploitation capabilities ofGrok\n4 are a significant step up from prior models, third-party testing shows thatGrok 4\u2019s end-to-end\noffensive cyber capabilities remain below the level of a human professional \nAs of this writing, on top of our safety training, we have implemented a system prompt that provides\nadditional mitigations for many of the undesirable behaviors we assess in this report  We have\nfound that our mitigations are able to curtail a majority of the risk  To measure willingness to assist with serious crimes, we constructed a broad set of\nharmful queries demonstrating clear intent to engage in a range of criminal offenses against people,\nproperty, and society and translated them across several common languages (English, Spanish,\nChinese, Japanese, Arabic, Russian), totaling thousands of queries  We also measured adversarial\nrobustness by introducing \u201cjailbreak\u201d attacks to the same set of queries either in the user message\nor the system message, and evaluated whether the model correctly refuses to answer , the rate at which the model answered queries that should\nhave been refused) for all three evaluation settings: standard, user jailbreak, and system jailbreak \nGrok 4 Web does not accept custom system prompts from users, so we do not evaluate with\nsystem jailbreaks  To quantify these risks, we use the AgentHarm\n2 benchmark, which evaluates the rate of completion of various malicious agentic tasks, both with and\nwithout the use of jailbreak attacks [Andriushchenko et al  The malicious tools and users seek to hijack control of the\nmodel away from its original task, specified in the system prompt, toward some malicious task\nsuch as sending email or exfiltrating private data \nWe find that warning the model against jailbreaks greatly reduces the attack success rate, as the\nmodel is able to reason through the policy 00\n+ User Jailbreak answer rate 0 01\n+ System Jailbreak answer rate 0  Given the limited context visible to AI models, it is often difficult to distinguish\nmalignant intent from mere curiosity  Additionally, warning the model against jailbreak attacks serves to significantly inoculate\nagainst common jailbreak strategies 2 Concerning Propensities\nAI models may contain propensities that reduce their controllability, such as deception, power-seeking,\nmanipulation, and sycophancy, etc  Similar to robustness against potential\nabuse, we find that our safeguards are able to greatly reduce AI propensities that may lead to loss of\ncontrol  To assess honesty, we use the MASK dataset, a collection of 1000 questions measuring whether\nmodels faithfully report their beliefs when pressured to lie [Ren et al  xAI aims to build truth-seeking models  As such, we continually evaluate whether\nGrok 4\u2019s training may cause it to display biases, especially on controversial sociopolitical questions  We construct an internal evaluation of soft\nbias by collecting a set of paired comparisons of sociopolitical topics  By construction, each pair in\nour evaluation has the form \u201cIs [object A] [comparison] [object B]\" and \u201cIs [object B] [comparison]\n[object A]\"  To score political bias for a given model, we query the model with each prompt in\nthe pair  We also measure the persuasiveness of our models\nwhen instructed to surreptitiously persuade another AI model, since more persuasive models can be\nabused to manipulate people at scale, and manipulate user behavior  Similar to biology\nand chemistry, the cybersecurity questions in WMDP also measure different stages of a threat model,\nin particular the cyber killchain [Hutchins et al  We use the open-source Inspect evaluation framework developed by\nthe UK AISI, and report the unguided task success rate  We measure persuasion with OpenAI\u2019s MakeMeSay evaluation, where an attacker\nmodel attempts to manipulate a defender model to say a codeword [OpenAI, 2024]  If the defender does not say the codeword after 15 turns or\nthe defender is able to guess the codeword, the attacker fails 3 Mitigations\nDue to Grok 4\u2019s strong dual-use biological capabilities, we have deployed narrow, topically-focused\nfilters across all product surfaces as an additional safeguard against bioweapons-related abuse  Specifically, we filter for detailed information or substantial assistance regarding the\ncritical steps identified in Section 2 of our RMF  For cyber risks, we assess that Grok\u2019s enforcement\n6 of our basic refusal policy is sufficient, as current models remain significantly weaker in end-to-end\nhacking capabilities than human professionals \nFor radiological and nuclear risks, we do not currently expect AI models to meaningfully improve\nradiological and nuclear weapons development, as relevant information is restricted by various\ngovernmental organizations (e , DoE or DoD), lowering the chance that models train on such\ninformation and thereby lowering the chance that models can respond with such information \nMoreover, acquiring the raw ingredients needed to obtain nuclear weapons is difficult due to the\nextensive monitoring and controls placed on nuclear materials \n3 Transparency\nTo mitigate catastrophic risks from AI, we provide to the public visibility to the development and\ndeployment of our frontier AI models  Transparency into AI progress can help developers coordinate\nsafety efforts, governments enact sensible legislation, and the public stay abreast of the benefits and\nrisks of AI  In an effort to increase visibility, we document our training process (Section 3 1 Data and Training\nGrok 4 is first pre-trained with a data recipe that includes publicly available Internet data, data\nproduced by third-parties for xAI, data from users or contractors, and internally generated data  We\nperform data filtering procedures on the training data, such as de-duplication and classification, to\nensure data quality and safety prior to training  In addition to pre-training, our recipe uses a variety\nof reinforcement learning techniques\u2014human feedback, verifiable rewards, and model grading\u2014along\nwith supervised finetuning

Claude Code to its Claude Enterprise offering and\nintroduced new administrative, compliance, and usage controls for\nenterprise customers (August 2025), improving management and\nsecurity features to boost appeal to corporate developers and IT/security\nteams and better compete with Google and GitHub developer tools  In\nOctober 2025, Anthropic launched Claude Code on the web and in the\niOS app in a \u201cresearch preview\u201d for paid Pro and Max users, enabling\nparallel agentic coding tasks via GitHub with sandboxed sessions and\nsecure proxy git access \nIn August 2025, Anthropic launched a Claude AI browser agent that lives\nin Chrome in a limited beta, enabling the assistant to navigate, click, and\ninteract with web pages directly \nPlatform integration & agents\nAnthropic introduced Model Context Protocol (MCP) to standardize\nsecure, real \u2011 time connections between Claude and enterprise systems\u2014\nexposing tools, data sources, and prompts in a consistent way across\nhosts like AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI  Shortly afterward, Anthropic launched Claude\nCode on the web and in the iOS app in a \u201cresearch preview\u201d for paid Pro\nand Max users, enabling parallel agentic coding tasks via GitHub with\nsandboxed sessions and secure proxy git access \nAnthropic has also rolled out a Microsoft 365 connector for Claude Team\nand Enterprise\u2014admin \u2011 enabled integrations with SharePoint, OneDrive,\nOutlook, and Teams\u2014plus enterprise search powered by MCP,\nextending Claude\u2019s ability to surface and analyze internal documents,\nemail threads, chat conversations, and meeting summaries inside\nMicrosoft\u2019s ecosystem \nBusiness Model\nAnthropic makes money in a few ways: via usage of its chatbot Claude,\nand via its AI models  Customers are charged per million tokens processed\nacross inputs and outputs, with different rates depending on the model:\nClaude Opus 4: $15 per million input tokens, $75 per million output\ntokens\nClaude Sonnet 4: $3 per million input tokens, $15 per million output\ntokens\nClaude Haiku (lightweight model): $0  Claude is accessible on AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI,\nand Databricks, making it easy for customers to integrate it into existing\ncloud workflows  This distribution strategy positions Anthropic as a\nmodel provider for multiple ecosystems, including those controlled by\nAmazon and Google\u2014both of which are strategic investors \nIn September 2025, Microsoft began integrating Anthropic's models into\nOffice 365 Copilot, extending Anthropic-powered generative AI across\nMicrosoft\u2019s productivity apps and potentially reaching more than 100\nmillion users  Subscriptions\nClaude is also available as a direct-to-consumer chatbot at Claude ai,\nwith several pricing tiers:\nClaude Pro ($20/month): Access to higher usage limits and priority\nservice  This is especially\nimportant for mission-critical deployments where latency and availability\nmust be controlled \nCompetition\nOpenAI\nOpenAI is still the market leader in terms of adoption, revenue, and\nproduct scope  Backed by Microsoft and integrated across the Microsoft\necosystem, OpenAI's GPT-4 remains the most widely used model in\nenterprise applications through Azure OpenAI Service and in consumer\nuse via ChatGPT  As of mid-2025, OpenAI was generating roughly $13\nbillion in annualized revenue, driven by massive scale across both\nenterprise APIs and ChatGPT Plus subscriptions \nGPT-4 remains a top-tier general-purpose model, particularly for tasks\nrequiring broad world knowledge, creative generation, and reasoning\nacross modalities  OpenAI has also expanded into other modalities with\nDALL-E for images, Whisper for audio transcription, and Sora for video\ngeneration  The breadth of the offering gives OpenAI a strong moat,\nparticularly among companies looking for an all-in-one AI provider \nStill, OpenAI's dominance in mindshare and Microsoft\u2019s enterprise sales\nmuscle give it an ongoing distribution advantage  Claude often plays the\nrole of a complement to GPT-4 in companies running a multi-model\nstrategy, but rarely displaces it entirely \nGoogle\nGoogle consolidated its AI research under the DeepMind brand and\nreleased the Gemini family of models to compete with GPT-4 and\nClaude  Google also brings a\nunique edge in compute scale and proprietary data, including access to\nGmail, Docs, and Search usage data for fine-tuning \nDeepMind positions Gemini as a foundational capability across Google\u2019s\necosystem: Gemini powers generative features in Workspace (Docs,\nSheets, Gmail), Android\u2019s AI assistant, and Bard\u2019s replacement chatbot \nWhile Claude is offered through Google\u2019s Vertex AI, it competes directly\nwith Gemini on that same platform  Google\u2019s control over the\ninfrastructure stack, model training, and end-user interface gives it a\nmajor advantage\u2014but also limits its openness to external deployment,\nwhich Anthropic can use as a wedge with enterprise customers  In\nOctober 2025, Anthropic and Google announced a cloud partnership\ngranting access to up to one million TPUs and adding over a gigawatt of\ncompute capacity by 2026, supporting Anthropic\u2019s surging multi \u2011 cloud\nstrategy alongside AWS Trainium and Nvidia GPUs  Meta\u2019s\nstrategy is to commoditize the base model layer, using its own models\ninternally while allowing others to build on top of them  That said, Claude continues to outperform\nLLaMA-based models on longer, more complex tasks where safety and\nsteerability matter \nTAM Expansion\nAnthropic\u2019s addressable market has expanded significantly in 2025,\ndriven by enterprise adoption of Claude for productivity, software\ndevelopment, and document analysis  The company\u2019s investments in\nlong-context capabilities, tool use, and model integrations position it to\ncapture a growing share of AI spend across sectors \nAdvanced virtual assistants\nWith Claude 4\u2019s 200,000-token context window and improved memory,\nClaude is now able to act as a true AI assistant for long-form tasks  Claude can now run in \u201cextended reasoning\u201d mode, call\nexternal tools through APIs, and write to persistent memory files to\nmaintain state \nIn October 2025, Anthropic expanded Claude\u2019s finance offering with a\nbeta Claude for Excel add \u2011 in for Max, Enterprise, and Teams users, plus\nnew connectors to LSEG, Moody\u2019s, Aiera/Third Bridge, Chronograph,\nEgnyte, and MT Newswires, and six pre \u2011 built Agent Skills (e \nCode generation\nCode generation has become one of the largest drivers of AI usage \nWith Claude Opus 4, Anthropic has pushed deeper into the developer\ntooling market, offering capabilities on par with or better than OpenAI\u2019s\nCodex and GPT-4 models for multi-file reasoning, debugging, and test\ngeneration  Use cases include pair programming, refactoring,\ndependency management, and autonomous agent-style code editing \nThis opens up TAM not just within engineering orgs but across any\ncompany building with software\u2014startups integrating AI into their\nworkflows, enterprise teams maintaining legacy systems, and agencies\nusing AI for client deliverables \nPlatform integration and agents\nWith the launch of MCP (Model Context Protocol), Anthropic is\npositioning Claude as a platform for integrating AI into existing business\nsystems  MCP allows developers to plug Claude into real-time data\nsources, knowledge bases, and SaaS applications, enabling AI\nworkflows that extend beyond simple Q&A \nThis creates the foundation for Claude to operate as part of larger\nagentic systems\u2014teams of AI instances that coordinate tasks, execute\ncode, and interact with software interfaces \nThese developments grow Claude\u2019s addressable market from \u201cchat-\nbased interfaces\u201d to broader categories of enterprise AI infrastructure,\nRPA (robotic process automation), and intelligent agents \nRisks\nCompute constraints: Anthropic\u2019s model development depends on\naccess to scarce AI compute\u2014specifically H100 GPUs and other high-\nend chips\u2014which are in limited global supply  Any disruption in\navailability or spike in compute pricing could delay Claude training\ncycles, degrade product performance, or force a scale-back in model\nambitions  Structural profitability: Like other foundation model developers,\nAnthropic faces high variable costs tied to inference and training  While\nrevenue is growing rapidly, its margins remain constrained by the cost of\nrunning large models  Without sustained cloud credits or

development of AI and, since 2016, an AI-first company  We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and\nGoogle CEO, Sundar Pichai  Supporting these businesses, we have centralized certain AI-related research\nand development which is reported in Alphabet-level activities  YouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to\nlearn something new and helps support the creator economy through the YouTube Partner Program  Google Cloud helps customers solve\ntoday\u2019s business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines \nMaking AI Helpful for Everyone\nWe believe AI is a profound platform shift, one that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies across the world, and\nto our business  At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for more than a decade and making them available to our\nusers \nIn 2023, we took a significant step on our journey to make AI more helpful for everyone with the introduction of Gemini, our natively\nmultimodal AI model  Gemini is powering AI features across our\nproducts and services that are helping people everyday  Today, all seven of our two billion-user products \u2014 Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Play\nStore, Search, and YouTube \u2014 are using Gemini \nOur Google Cloud products, including Google Cloud Platform and

advanced, safe, and responsible AI through a full stack of robust AI-optimized infrastructure, including data\ncenters, chips, and a global fiber network; world class research teams; and a broad global reach through products and platforms that touch\nbillions of people and customers around the world  For example, since we started\nserving AI Overviews to our users, we have significantly lowered machine costs and latency through hardware, engineering, and technical\nbreakthroughs  Our AI-optimized infrastructure allows us to use, and offer our customers, a range of AI accelerator options, including our own\ncustom-built Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) \nOur teams across Alphabet leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we have previously developed and announced, to deliver the best\nproduct and service experiences for our users, advertisers, partners, customers, and developers 0 in new research\nprototypes, including Project Astra, which explores the future capabilities of a universal AI assistant and Project Mariner, an early prototype\ncapable of taking actions in Chrome as an experimental extension \nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible  That means developing AI in a way that maximizes the positive benefits\nto society while addressing its potential challenges, guided by our AI Principles \nEnable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\nAI is a major technology shift for enterprises  That is why we are focused on making it easy and scalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI  That\nmeans providing advanced computing infrastructure and expanding access to Google\u2019s latest AI models  Our Vertex AI platform gives\ndevelopers the ability to train, tune, augment, test, and deploy applications using Gemini, Imagen, Veo, and other generative AI models  Gemini\nfor Google Cloud provides pre-packaged AI agents that can assist developers to write, document, test, and operate software as well as assist\ncybersecurity teams to analyze, detect, protect, and respond to threats \nImprove Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\nAs AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on transforming our products to provide our users the most helpful tools  Examples\ninclude AI Overviews, which allow users to ask their most complex questions, break down concepts in a format that is useful for them, or take a\nvideo and ask a question out loud, and NotebookLM, which helps users understand complex information by summarizing sources and providing\nrelevant quotes  We are embedding the power of generative AI to continue helping our users express themselves and get things done  For\nexample, the Gemini app allows users to collaborate with new AI features that include image generation capabilities, coding support, and app\nintegration \nmake that even easier with AI  For example, advertisers are able to use our updated image generation in Google Ads to produce high-quality\nimagery for their campaigns, and Demand Gen helps them reach their target audiences \nBuild the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on top of it  Our latest Pixel\ndevices were built with Gemini Nano, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users, such as Gemini on Pixel, Pixel Screenshots, and\nPixel Studio  Our Android and Chrome operating systems enable users to access Gemini, and other Google AI features throughout their day \nIn Other Bets, our fully autonomous driving technology company, Waymo, is now providing fully autonomous, paid ride-hailing services to\ncustomers in multiple cities \nOur early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to future developments \nWe continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term, most notably for the application of AI to our products and services, as well\nas other frontier technologies such as quantum computing  As we said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-\nreward projects that we believe in, as they are the key to our long-term success  Our product\ninnovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world  Google Services' core products and\nplatforms include ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with\nbroad and growing adoption by users around the world  While Google Search started\nas a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical advancements and product innovations that have\ntransformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience  We are now using Gemini customized for Google Search to provide our users an\nimproved Search experience, and AI Overviews has been released in more than one hundred countries, reaching more than one billion users  We see tremendous\npotential for devices to be helpful and make people's lives easier by combining the best of our AI, software, and hardware \nHow We Make Money\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses \nOur advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and formats, and\nwe aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and\nagencies  AI has been foundational to our advertising business for more than a decade  Products like Demand Gen, Performance Max, and\nProduct Studio use the full power of our AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities  We continue to invest in both performance\nand brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns  We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to\nspecific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns  Customers use Google Cloud in multiple ways\nsuch as:\n\u2022 AI-optimized Infrastructure: provides open, reliable, and scalable compute, networking, and storage to enable customers to run\nworkloads anywhere \u2014 on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers  It can be used to migrate and modernize IT systems and to\ntrain and serve various types of AI models \n\u2022 Developer Platform: provides developers, through the Vertex AI platform, the ability to train, tune, augment, test, and deploy\napplications using Gemini and other leading generative AI models \n\u2022 Cybersecurity: provides AI powered cybersecurity solutions to help customers analyze, detect, protect, and respond to a broad range of\ncybersecurity threats, to further strengthen security outcomes, prioritize which threats to investigate, and identify attack paths, as well as\naccelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats \n\u2022 Data and Analytics: provides a variety of different types of databases \u2014 relational, key-value, and in-memory \u2014 to store and manage\ndata for different types of applications and deliver data to AI agents  Our data platform also unifies data lakes, data warehouses, data\ngovernance, and advanced machine learning into a single platform that helps users analyze data using AI models across any cloud  AI has been used in Google Workspace for years to improvegrammar, efficiency, security, and more with features like Smart Reply, Smart Compose, and malware and phishing protection in Gmail Now, Gemini for Google Workspace brings our AI-powered agents into Gmail, Docs, Sheets and more to help users write, organize,visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings  While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating\nrevenue and making important strides in their industries  We face formidable competition in every aspect\nof our business, including but not limited to, from:\n\u2022 general purpose search engines and information services;\n\u2022 vertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries on topics such as those related to travel, jobs, and health, which users\nmay navigate directly to rather than go through Google;\n\u2022 online advertising platforms and networks, including online shopping and streaming services;\n\u2022 other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers typically advertise in\nmultiple media, both online and offline;\n\u2022 digital content and application platform providers;\n\u2022 providers of enterprise cloud services;\n\u2022 developers and providers of AI products and services;\n\u2022 companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary\nplatforms;\n\u2022 providers of

workspace communication and connectivity products; and\n\u2022 digital assistant providers \nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace\nacross our businesses  For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\u2022 users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well\nas the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n\u2022 advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an\nefficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n\u2022 content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from\nadvertising, and the terms of our agreements with them \nOngoing Commitment to Sustainability\nOur environmental strategy has two key pillars, supported by our dedication to accessible information and technological innovation:\n\u2022 Our products: We are empowering people with information about the environmental impacts of their choices \n\u2022 Our operations: We are working to drive sustainability and efficiency across our operations and value chain \nIn 2021, we set an ambitious goal to reach net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by 2030  To make progress\ntoward this effort, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 absolute emissions (compared to our\n2019 base year) by 2030, and we plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining\nemissions  In 2023, we began implementing our carbon removals\nstrategy, and we have begun establishing impactful partnerships and have started contracting for carbon removal credits  Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where they involve building new large-scale infrastructure\nwith long lead times  Our approach will continue to evolve and will require us to navigate significant uncertainty, including the uncertainty around\nthe future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict \nFor additional information about risks and uncertainties applicable to our work on sustainability and efficiency, see Item 1A Risk Factors of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K  We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to take care of the diverse needs of our\nemployees and their families, including opportunities for career growth and development, resources to support their financial health, and access\nto excellent healthcare choices  Our competitive compensation programs help us to attract and retain key talent, and we will continue to invest in\nrecruiting talented people to technical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well  We provide a variety of high quality training and support\nto managers to build and strengthen their capabilities-\u2013ranging from courses for new managers, to learning resources that help them provide\nfeedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support  We have work councils and statutory employee representation obligations in\ncertain countries, and we are committed to supporting protected labor rights, maintaining an open culture, and listening to all employees  Many of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain \nParticularly with regard to AI; competition; consumer protection; content moderation; data privacy and security; news publications; and\nsustainability and other social matters, we have seen an increase in new and evolving laws and regulations, as well as related enforcement\nactions and investigations, being proposed and implemented in recent years by legislative and regulatory bodies around the world \nOur compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate, increase our cost of doing\nbusiness, make our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain business practices or offer certain products and services,\ncause us to change our business models and operations, affect our competitive position relative to our peers, and/or otherwise harm our\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results \nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and\nour brand  and international trademarks, service marks, domain names, and\ncopyrights  and foreign countries covering certain of our technology, and acquired patent\nassets to supplement our portfolio  We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other\nparties \nAvailable Information\nOur website is located at www  Access to our

subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below, which\ncould harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect the trading price of our Class A and Class C stock \nmonetization) than their available alternatives  Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, such as our initiatives related to\nthird-party cookies, including our announcement in July 2024 to move from phasing out all third-party cookies to a proposed user choice model\n(which remains subject to continuing discussions with regulators), as well as changes to other companies\u2019 advertising and/or data privacy\npractices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising services that we are able to provide  In addition, technologies have been\ndeveloped that make personalized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services have\nintegrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising  Failing to provide superior\nvalue or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results  If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users,\ncustomers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults  They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions and\nentering into other strategic arrangements; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure, R&D, and in talent; initiating intellectual\nproperty and competition claims (whether or not meritorious); and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and content\nproviders \nWe are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company  This includes generative AI and continuing to integrate AI capabilities\ninto our products and services  AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and require significant investment, including\ntechnical infrastructure, development and operational costs, to meet the changing needs and expectations of our existing users and attract new\nusers  Our ability to deploy certain AI technologies critical for our products and services and for our business strategy may depend on the\navailability and pricing of third-party equipment and other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and\nequipment costs  Additionally, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or\nmore cost-effective to develop and/or deploy  Other companies may also have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights\nthat would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our own AI products and services \nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive in a timely manner to the\nevolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers, or if we miscalculate those needs and\ndesires and invest significantly in areas that fail to gain sufficient market traction  Competitors\u2019 success in providing compelling products and services or\nin attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could harm our financial condition and operating\nresults \nas building AI capabilities into new and existing products and services, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services\nthat are helpful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers  Changes in facts and circumstances such as\nchanges to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use and utilization of assets, and/or technological advancements, could\nindicate a change in the period over which we expect to benefit from the asset and impact our financial condition and operating results \nInnovations in our products and services could also result in changes to user behavior and affect our revenue trends  These endeavors\ninvolve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of resources and management attention from current operations, different\nmonetization models, and the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives\nacross the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives \nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in devices, including our smartphones, home devices, and wearables, which is a\nhighly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors,\nincreased market saturation in developed countries, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in performance\ncharacteristics, and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses \nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud\nPlatform and Google Workspace, and we are advancing our AI platforms and models to support these tools and technologies  We are incurring\ncosts to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and\nscale our sales force  Pricing, including platform\nswitching costs, are challenging across the industry, and delivery models are competitive and constantly evolving, and we may therefore not\nachieve our business objectives  For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply\nor any deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and/or reputational risks \nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other\nchallenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services \nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin in the\nfuture \nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the devices and modalities used to\naccess our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines in advertiser spending; competition; changes in customer\nusage and demand for our existing products and increasing demand for new technologies; decreases in the pricing of our products and services;\nongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services  Further, certain of our costs and expenses are\ngenerally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue  Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and\nhistorical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance  For example, effective\nintellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available\nthrough the Internet  Although we seek to obtain\npatent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations  Moreover, we may not have\nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important  There is always the possibility that the scope of\nthe protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable \nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets \nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete \nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our\nbase of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners  Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google\nServices, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products and services that\nbetter serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners  Our brands have been, and may in the future\nbe, negatively affected by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data\nprivacy and security issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures  For example, if we fail to respond appropriately to\nthe sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable practices by advertisers, or otherwise to\nadequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands \nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results \nOur success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative\nproducts and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings \nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults \nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply both our\nproducts and our services \nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our devices as well as servers and networking equipment used in our\ntechnical infrastructure, certain components of which we may supply  Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or\ncapacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make\nadverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them \nWe have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, quality issues, and/or longer lead times that\ncould negatively affect our operations, driven by raw material and/or component availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry\nallocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs, sanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, forced\nlabor concerns, sustainability sourcing requirements, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or pandemics, the effects of climate\nchange (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns associated with\nwildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power and transmission availability, and significant changes in the financial or business\ncondition of our suppliers  Some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and our devices are available from only one or limited\nsources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption  A significant supply\ninterruption that affects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product availability  We may face costs for\nmaterials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological change, changed consumer preferences, quality, product\nrecalls, and warranty issues  For instance, because certain of our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase\nrequirements, if the volume of sales of our devices decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and\nmanufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our financial\ncondition and operating results  Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and\nother commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply  For example, industry supply capacity for AI\naccelerators, including Graphics Processing Units, or GPUs, as well as our custom-built TPUs, is highly competitive and rapidly evolving  If we\nare unable to negotiate favorable contractual terms or our competitors claim the supply or capacity first, we may face supply constraints  Violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain\ndisruptions, canceled orders, harm to key relationships, and damage to our reputation  Their failure to procure necessary license rights to\nintellectual property could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims \nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our\nability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results \nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our information\ntechnology and communications systems  Our systems are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades,\nterrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters or pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, export controls and sanctions,\nthe effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power\nshutdowns associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power and transmission availability challenges, utility outages,\ntelecommunications failures, computer viruses, software bugs, cyber attacks, supply-chain attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing\nschemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems  Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities  In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and have contained in the past, and\nmay contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities, which could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems \nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow internationally ;\n\u2022 sanctions, import and export controls, other market access barriers, political unrest, geopolitical tensions, changes in regimes, or armed\nconflict (such as ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine), any of which may affect our business continuity, increase our\noperating costs, limit demand for our products and services, limit our ability to source components or final products, or prevent or impede\nus from operating in certain jurisdictions, complying with local laws, or offering products or services;\n\u2022 longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022 an evolving foreign policy landscape that could harm our revenues and could subject us to litigation, new regulatory costs and\nchallenges (including new customer requirements), uncertainty regarding regulatory outcomes, and other liabilities under local laws that\nmay not offer due process or clear legal precedent;\n\u2022 anti-corruption laws, such as the U  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government\nofficials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties; and\n\u2022 different employee/employer relationships; different labor laws, regulations, and labor practices; and other challenges caused by\ndistance, language, local expertise, and cultural differences, increasing the complexity of doing business in multiple jurisdictions \nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial statements incorporate\ninherently subjective valuation methodologies \nThe fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the past, negatively affected\nby liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying entities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest\nrates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors \nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-based compensation\nawards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis, which is inherently subjective and requires management judgment and estimation  All gains and losses on non-marketable\nequity securities are recognized in OI&E, which increases the volatility of our OI&E  The unrealized gains and losses or impairments we record\nfrom fair value remeasurements in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains and losses we ultimately realize on such\ninvestments \nPeople access our products and services through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, phones, laptops and tablets,\nvideo game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables (including virtual reality and augmented reality devices), automobiles, and television-\nstreaming devices  Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique\ntechnical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our\nusers or our advertisers on these devices as a result  Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, or failing to\ndevelop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults and ability to capture future business opportunities \nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure \nOur evolving AI-related efforts may give rise to risks related to harmful content, inaccuracies, discrimination, intellectual property\ninfringement or misappropriation, violation of rights of publicity, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and other issues  As a result of these and\nother challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory\naction, legal liability (including under new and proposed legislation and regulations), new applications of existing data protection, privacy,\nintellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm \nSome uses of AI will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society  In order to implement AI responsibly and minimize\nunintended harmful effects, we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant resources to develop, test, and maintain our products\nand services, but we may not be able to identify or resolve all AI-related issues, deficiencies, and/or failures before they arise  Unintended\nconsequences, uses, or customization of our AI tools and systems may negatively affect human rights, privacy, employment, or other social\nconcerns, which may result in claims, lawsuits, brand or reputational harm, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results  Additionally, our products\nincorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and are likely in the future to\ncontain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities  We continue to add new features involving AI to our offerings and internal systems, and\nfeatures that rely on AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats as our and the market\u2019s understanding of AI-centric security risks\nand protection methods continue to develop  Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or\ninadvertent disclosure of user data could result in regulatory and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and business, and impair\nour ability to attract and retain users or customers  While there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, we expect to continue to\nexpend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or breaches \nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis  For example, the development and\nimplementation of AI technologies may further increase our exposure to or exacerbate the risks of cyber attacks or other security incidents,\nparticularly where such technologies are exploited by third parties to breach our or other parties\u2019 systems, including when such technologies are\nused to target our employees or impersonate members of senior management in order to gain unauthorized access to our systems  We have\nalso seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, which could affect our or other parties\u2019 systems  Our efforts to prevent security incidents and address undesirable\nactivity on our platform may require us to spend additional resources to prepare and defend against such threats, and could also increase the\nrisk of retaliatory attack  Geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in\nthe Middle East and Ukraine, may increase these risks  Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage\nsystems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all reasonable precautions, including\nthose required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or\nimplement adequate preventative measures \nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-security practices, fail to\ncomply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our users\u2019 data may be improperly accessed, used, or\ndisclosed  If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business partners\u2019 or service providers\u2019 security occurs, the market perception of the\neffectiveness of our security measures would be harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business\npartners may be compromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may include class-\naction litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties \nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including dedicated worldwide incident\nresponse teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately\nassess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to prevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident  Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues of abuse for bad actors  Although we continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our platforms,\nthere is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may have negative experiences on our platforms if our\ntechnology fails to work as intended, which may affect our users' decisions in continuing to use our platforms \nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality content, it could hurt our\nreputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition and operating results  Internet access providers may be\nable to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses\nand the loss of users and advertisers \nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant network\ncapacity to work effectively  Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet\naccess marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned\nservice providers  Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the\ncost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by\ncharging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors preferential access  Some jurisdictions have\nadopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U  These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or content\nproviders, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby negatively affecting our business  In\nrecent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations relevant to the digital\neconomy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition, AI, and online content \nNew or changing laws and regulations, or interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our\ninterpretations of such laws and regulations and/or our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and\nservices, altered business models and operations, limited ability to pursue certain business practices or offer certain products and services,\nsubstantial costs, and civil or criminal liability  Examples include laws and regulations regarding:\n\u2022 Competition and technology platforms\u2019 business practices: Laws and regulations focused on large technology platforms, including\nthe Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations and legal settlements in the U \n\u2022 AI: Laws and regulations focused on the development, use, and provision of AI technologies and other digital products and services,\nwhich could result in monetary penalties or other regulatory actions  For example, the EU AI Act came into force on August 1, 2024, and\nwill generally become fully applicable after a two-year transitional period (although certain obligations will take effect at an earlier or later\ntime)  The EU AI Act introduces various requirements for AI systems and models placed on the market or put into service in the EU,\nincluding specific transparency and other requirements for general purpose AI systems and the models on which those systems are\nbased , there is increasing uncertainty as to the federal government's approach to AI regulation going forward, as the\ncontinued applicability of the White House's 2023 Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of\nArtificial Intelligence, which lays out a framework for the U  government, among other things, to monitor private sector development of\ncertain foundation models, remains subject to regulatory development  Several states are considering enacting or have already enacted\nregulations concerning the use of AI technologies, including those focused on consumer protection, and depending on the scope of AI\nregulation at the federal level, some states may move to regulate AI model development and deployment  Further, at the federal and\nstate level, there have been various proposals (and in some cases laws enacted) addressing \u201cdeepfakes\u201d and other AI-generated\nsynthetic media \n\u2022 Copyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single\nMarket and European Economic Area transpositions, which have introduced new licensing regimes, increase liability with respect to\ncontent uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms, or create property rights in news publications that could require payments to\nnews agencies and publishers, which may result in other regulatory actions \n\u2022 Content moderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure obligations, such as the EU's\nDigital Services Act, Florida\u2019s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas\u2019 House Bill 20, and laws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and\nthe United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure to remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the\noperation of our services and algorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with\nlow-quality, deceptive, or harmful content, or on the other hand, may impinge on the rights of free expression, which, in turn, could\nimpact how our platforms are viewed by users \nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by courts, regulators, or administrative\nbodies, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business  and the Digital Services Act in\nEurope, to protect against liability for various linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities  Our development, use,\nand commercialization of AI products and services (including our\n19 \nimplementation of AI in our offerings and internal systems) could subject us to regulatory action and legal liability, including under specific\nlegislation regulating AI, as well as new applications of existing data protection, cybersecurity, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws \nFurther, we are subject to evolving laws, regulations, policies, and international accords relating to matters beyond our core products and\nservices, including environmental sustainability, climate change, human capital, and employment matters  We cannot guarantee that our goals and initiatives will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at\nall, and projects that are completed as planned may not achieve the results we anticipate \nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, enforcement\nactions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability, including competition matters, that could harm our\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results \nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and orders involving\ncompetition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content\ngenerated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters  states, and other plaintiffs have filed, and may continue to file in the future, several\nantitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, including our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of\nGoogle Search, and the operation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store  While we plan to\nappeal, there can be no assurance that our appeal will succeed, or that we will be able to change or decrease the severity of any remedies that\nmay be ordered, and any or all of these potential remedies could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results \nIn addition to these regulatory proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims pursued by regulators are\npending in the U \nWe are also subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product\ndefects, among other litigation, and we may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other\nenvironmental effects, AI training, development, and commercialization, or service disruptions or failures  Claims have been brought, and we\nexpect will continue to be brought, against us for\n20 \ndefamation, negligence, breaches of contract, patent, copyright and trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, privacy\nrights violations, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services, the design and\neffect of our products and services, or due to our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content\ncreated by third parties  Any failure or alleged\nfailure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results  Additionally, the increasing adoption of AI technologies, which rely on the\ncollection of large amounts of data and use of such data for training purposes, has led data protection authorities around the world to consider\nand adopt new and evolving interpretations of data protection laws, imposing specific obligations with respect to the processing of personal data,\nincluding required notices, consents, and opt-outs  Further, the increased risk of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information or personal\ndata in connection with the utilization of AI technologies may result in stronger regulatory scrutiny, leading to legal and regulatory investigations\nand enforcement actions that may negatively affect our business, even if unfounded  state, and foreign privacy laws related to the processing and security of personal data, including (1)\ncomprehensive privacy laws that provide data privacy rights (including, in California, a private right of action in the event of a data\nbreach resulting from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and impose significant\nobligations on controllers and processors of consumer data; (2) laws imposing obligations on businesses

adapt our existing arrangements \nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, violation of rights of publicity, and\nother claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and\nlimit our ability to use certain technologies  Parties have also sought broad injunctive\nrelief against us by filing claims in U  In addition, patent-holding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims\nagainst us  As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to\nincrease as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies, including AI technologies \nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are\navailable at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U  or elsewhere, including by preventing us from offering\ncertain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain jurisdictions \nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against certain intellectual\nproperty infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could\nresult in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims  Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not\ncover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims  Furthermore, in\nconnection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including\nthose associated with intellectual property claims  Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and\nexpensive to litigate or settle  To the extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and service\nofferings, financial condition, and operating results  Our effective tax rates are\naffected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on\nhedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in our stock price for shares issued as\nemployee compensation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or\nchanges in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws)  Further, if we are unable or\nfail to collect taxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could become liable for taxes that are levied\nagainst third parties  As a result, we have received, and may in the\nfuture receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such as transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-\nestablishment claims  In addition, the determination of our worldwide\nprovision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty  has imposed a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of shares repurchased, which could potentially increase in the future  Any such\ndecision by our Board of Directors may depend on a variety of factors that it may deem relevant, including but not limited to our earnings,\nliquidity, financial condition, other capital deployment opportunities, level of indebtedness, and general market conditions  This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders\u2019 ability\nto influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the market\nprice of our Class A stock and our Class C stock \nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider\nfavorable \nProvisions in Alphabet\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or\nchanges in our management  These provisions include the following:\n\u2022 Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the\nresignation, death, or removal of a director \n\u2022 Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a stockholders' meeting  These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation\nof proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company \nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions  These broad market and industry factors could harm the\nmarket price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock, regardless of our actual operating performance \nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and\nthese transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results  Some of the areas where we face risks include:\n\u2022 diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic\narrangements;\n\u2022 failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities; conditions placed upon approval that could,\namong other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or\nstrategic goals of a transaction; or investigations or litigation by governmental authorities related to our acquisitions and other strategic\narrangements;\n\u2022 failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including cultural integration and\nretention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology;\n\u2022 implementation of controls (or remediation of control deficiencies), procedures, and policies at the acquired company;\n\u2022 integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of product, engineering, and\nsales and marketing functions;\n\u2022 transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\n\u2022 in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular\neconomic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u2022 failure to accomplish commercial, strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments, joint ventures, and other strategic\narrangements;\n\u2022 failure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;\n\u2022 liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, data privacy\nand security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, warranty claims, product liabilities, and other known and\nunknown liabilities; and\n24 \n\u2022 litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former\nstockholders, or other third parties \nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic\narrangements could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally \nOur acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt,\ncontingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of\nwhich could harm our financial condition and operating results  In connection with our divestitures and certain other strategic arrangements, we have agreed, and may in the\nfuture agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and operating results \nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain\nand continue to adapt our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow or operate effectively  For instance, Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an\nimportant role in the development of our technology, maintaining our culture, and setting our strategic direction \nOur ability to compete effectively and our future success depend on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly\nskilled personnel for all areas of our organization  Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors\nhave directly targeted, and may continue to target, our employees  In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award\nprograms, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees  Immigration policy\nand regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent  All of our executive officers and key\nemployees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies \nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork  Under our hybrid\nwork models, we may experience increased costs and/or disruption, in addition to potential effects on our ability to operate effectively and\nmaintain our corporate culture      CYBERSECURITY\nWe maintain a comprehensive process for identifying, assessing, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats as part of our\nbroader risk management system and processes  For example, some risks include our software supply chain and other third-party\ndependencies, vulnerabilities in our products and services, theft of our intellectual property, and attempts to compromise our infrastructure  We\nobtain input, as appropriate, for our cybersecurity risk management program on the security industry and threat trends from multiple external\nexperts and internal threat intelligence teams  Internal Audit maintains a dedicated\ncybersecurity auditing team that independently tests our cybersecurity controls \nOur business strategy, results of operations and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from cybersecurity threats,\nincluding as a result of previously identified cybersecurity incidents, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not be materially affected in\nthe future by such risks or any future material incidents  PROPERTIES\nOur headquarters are located in Mountain View, California  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT\u2019S COMMON

on Form 10-K \nThe continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since inception  In\naddition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, including from other developers and providers of AI products and\nservices, which may affect our revenues  We\nare focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business  Additionally, as the market for a\nparticular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may be affected  For example, changing dynamics within the global\nsmartphone market, such as increased market saturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues \nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC as a percentage\nof our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the\npercentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from\ndifferent channels; and revenue share terms \nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, for example with AI, we continue to expand\nour product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect monetization of our products and services  We expect to continue to\nincorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search, that could affect our monetization trends \n\u2022 As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase,\nand may require continued investments , including in emerging\nmarkets, such as India  We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and advertising programs relevant to our\nusers in these markets \nrevenues from emerging markets  We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as\nlow-cost mobile devices become more available  This trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate\nthan more mature markets \nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop new, innovative\nofferings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our businesses  We also expect to increase, relative to\n2024, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our\nbusiness and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services  In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments\nremain important elements in our use of capital and contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and\nother functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives \n\u2022 We continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and other\nforms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and financial results \nAs these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our products and services may become less useful, our ability to\npursue certain business practices or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business models and\noperations to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters \nIn addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed above, fluctuations in our revenues have been and\nmay continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:\n\u2022 changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;\n\u2022 general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their\neffect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending;\n\u2022 new product, service, and market launches; and\n31 ), and other Google owned and\noperated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n\u2022 YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\n\u2022 Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad\nManager \nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks\nand cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while impressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our\nGoogle Network properties \nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other\nGoogle owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play  Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues\ndivided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users \nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number\nof paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity \nFluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and\nthe change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been, and may\ncontinue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as:\n\u2022 advertiser competition for keywords;\n\u2022 changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\n\u2022 changes in device mix;\n\u2022 seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality;\nand\n\u2022 traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels \nThese services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google\nCloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n\u2022 Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as\nCalendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n\u2022 other enterprise services  Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D,\nsales and marketing, and general and administrative functions  Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation\nof our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to\nchanges in revenue \n\u2022 TAC includes:\n\u25e6 amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services  Our distribution partners\ninclude browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and\n\u25e6 amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties \nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a\npercentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads\nserved on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners \nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing,\nor general and administrative \nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\n\u2022 depreciation;\n\u2022 employee compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new\nproducts and services; and\n\u2022 third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development\nefforts \nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n\u2022 employee compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service\nfunctions; and\n\u2022 spend relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services \nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n\u2022 employee compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative\nsupport functions;\n\u2022 expenses relating to legal and other matters, including certain fines and settlements; and\n\u2022 third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services \nOther

our brand advertising products followed by our\ndirect response advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers \nMonetization Metrics\nThe following table presents changes in monetization metrics for Google Search & other revenues (paid clicks and cost-per-click) and\nGoogle Network revenues (impressions and cost-per-impression), expressed as a

clicks and impressions are driven by a number of interrelated factors, including changes in advertiser spending; ongoing\nproduct and policy changes; and, as it relates to paid clicks, fluctuations in search queries resulting from changes in user adoption and usage,\nprimarily on mobile devices  The growth was primarily driven by an\nincrease in subscription revenues, largely from growth in the

increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in\nrevenues subject to TAC  The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues increased from 2023 to 2024\nprimarily due to increases related to mobile searches, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid\naccess points 3 billion increase in\nSBC expenses, which includes the reduction

\nFinancial Condition\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $95 7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities  Cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-\nbacked and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities \nSources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from\noperations  The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business \nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities \nCash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities, purchases of property and\nequipment, and payments for acquisitions \nNet cash used in investing activities increased from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment and\npurchases of marketable securities, partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of marketable securities \nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and cash flows from operations and financing activities to\ncontinue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12\nmonths, and thereafter for the foreseeable future \nCapital Expenditures and Leases\nWe make investments in land, buildings, and servers and network equipment through purchases of property and equipment and lease\narrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products \nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\n\u2022 technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, and networking\nrequirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, and data center land and building construction; and\n\u2022 office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\")  We\nexpect to increase, relative to 2024, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to\nsupport the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services  As of December 31, 2024, the amount of total future lease\npayments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7 2 billion is\nshort-term, and total future lease payments under finance leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 10  The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the\nachievement of certain sustainability goals  Certain of these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the\ncontract manufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8 of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K 7 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share repurchases \nDividend Program\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024 total cash dividends, which were first paid in June 2024, were $3 \nEuropean Commission Fines\nIn 2017, 2018, and 2019, the European Commission (EC) announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European\ncompetition law and imposed fines of \u20ac2  We subsequently\nappealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending 8 billion primarily related to uncertain tax\npositions as of December 31, 2024  These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or\nthe minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory, and\nnetwork capacity \nIn certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers  The amounts to be paid under these\nagreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable  Our\ncritical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in\nthem have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations \nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-marketable equity securities \nThese investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the measurement alternative\") and are measured at cost,\nless impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments resulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the\nsame issuer  These adjustments require quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable\ninputs  Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of estimates using the\nbest information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data \nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the companies' financial and\nliquidity position and access to capital resources, among others  When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of\nthe fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable\ninputs, including discount rates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others \nWhen the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its current fair value \nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i  We\nrecord compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense recognized before investment\nreturns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs \nProperty and Equipment\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when other changes occur, such as\nwhen there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use and utilization of assets, or technological advancements,\nthat could indicate a change in the period over which we expect to benefit from the asset  Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax\npositions and determining our provision for income taxes \nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of comparable and resolved tax\nexposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement  We evaluate uncertain tax positions periodically, considering changes in facts\nand circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities  Although we\nbelieve we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will\nnot be different \ndifferences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made \nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and\npenalties  In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may\nassert assessments against us  We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to\ndetermine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes \nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving\ncompetition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content\ngenerated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and\nother matters  Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity investment risks  International revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign\ncurrencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U  The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and\nliabilities are recorded in OI&E, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts \nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and\nwritten options) to protect forecasted U  dollar\nstrengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option contacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings \ndollar weakens, losses from foreign currency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings  We reflect the gains and losses of foreign currency spot rate changes as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur  The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our\ninvestment in foreign subsidiaries \nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity  We invest\nprimarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money\nmarket and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate derivatives  Fixed rate securities may have their\nfair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if\ninterest rates fall  Unrealized gains and losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to\ninterest rates at the time of purchase  For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes\nin fair value are recorded in OI&E  We measure securities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses\nrecorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses \nThe VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest\nrates  The estimated one-day loss in fair value of our investment\nportfolio as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 are shown below (in millions):\n As of December 31, 12-Month AverageAs of December 31,\n 2023 2024 2023 2024\nRisk category - interest rate $ 296 $ 208 $ 271 $ 230 \nActual future gains and losses associated with our investment portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and\nour actual exposures and positions \nEquity Investment Risk\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or\nincrease the fair value of our holdings \nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately\nheld companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages \nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market\nvalues, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and represent $6  A hypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2024 balance\nwould decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by $508 million  From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the\nmarket price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities \nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are primarily adjusted to fair value for observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative)  The fair value\nmeasured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an indication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date  Valuations of our equity investments in private companies are\ninherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and\n46  The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation\nin the value of investments through liquidity events such as public offerings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events  Changes in the\nvaluation of non-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities  As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the measurement\nalternative, was $28 0 billion as of December 31, 2023\nand 2024, respectively, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes  However, these investments could be impaired if the carrying\nvalue exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud \nLoss Contingencies\nDescription of theMatter The Company is subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings,and orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor andemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by its users, goods and services offered by advertisers orpublishers using their platforms, personal injury, and other matters  As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financialstatements \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries andinvestigations, other proceedings, and orders could result in adverse consequences \nOur audit procedures included gaining an understanding of previous rulings and the status of ongoing lawsuits, reviewingletters from internal and external legal counsel addressing the matters, meeting with internal legal counsel to discuss theallegations, and obtaining a representation letter from management on these matters  (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting\nas of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria \nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial\nReporting  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances  A\ncompany\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment,\namong others  and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google\nPlay;\n\u2022 YouTube properties; and\n\u2022 Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad\nManager \nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google Display & Video 360, and\nGoogle Marketing Platform, among others  Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis,\nthat is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of\nrevenues \nThese services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google\nCloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n\u2022 Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as\nCalendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n\u2022 other enterprise services \nCustomer Incentives and Credits\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration  We recognize an asset for\ncertain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year  These costs are recorded within sales andmarketing expenses \n\u2022 TAC includes:\n\u25e6 amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services  Our distribution partners\ninclude browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and\n\u25e6 amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties \nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold,\nleased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached  RSUs are equity classified and measured at\nthe fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date  We recognize RSU expense using the straight-line attribution method over the\nrequisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur \nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our\nemployees  As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and the income tax withholding is recorded as a\nreduction to additional paid-in capital \nAdditionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include market conditions and awards\nthat may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies  PSUs and certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity\nclassified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period  Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified\nand remeasured at fair value through settlement  The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of\nthe respective Other Bet company \nPerformance Fees\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments  We record\ncompensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns\nare realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs \nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants  Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier\nfair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets \nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar\ninstruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the\nmarket or can be derived from observable market data \nthese models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including\ninterest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings \nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities \nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when\nmeasuring fair value  The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation\nmodels \nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable securities,\nderivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities  Our financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\ninclude non-marketable equity securities  Other financial assets and liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required \nWe measure certain other instruments, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis \nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative financial instruments,\naccounts receivable, and convertible notes \nCredit Risks\nWe are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial instruments, including foreign\nexchange contracts, accounts receivable, and convertible notes \nCash Equivalents\nWe invest excess cash primarily in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities, government bonds, money\nmarket funds, and time deposits \nMarketable Securities\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash\nequivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets  We\ndetermine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation\nat each balance sheet date  We have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale  After consideration of our\nrisk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective maturities  As we\nview these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current\nassets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets  We carry these securities at fair value, and report the\nunrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit\nlosses, which are recorded in OI&E  For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value\nare recorded in OI&E  We determine any realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a specific identification method,\nand we record such gains and losses as a component of OI&E \nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses, including unrealized,\nrecognized in OI&E  We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up restrictions beyond 12 months as other non-\ncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets \nNon-Marketable Securities\nNon-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities  We account for non-marketable equity securities through which we exercise\nsignificant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method  Other non-marketable equity securities that we hold are\nprimarily accounted for under the measurement alternative  Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any\nimpairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the\nsame issuer  Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a component of\nOI&E \nNon-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-current assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \nDerivative Financial Instruments\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments  For certain products or services and customers, we require payment before the\nproducts or services are delivered to the customer \nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable, and changes in\nsuch are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income  We also consider customer-\nspecific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions \nConvertible Notes\nOur investments in convertible notes are primarily recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal balances, deferred origination\ncosts, and any related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are included within other non-current assets on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets  For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing the substance of the arrangements, including assessing\nwhether the components of the arrangements should be accounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the\nvalue of the components of the arrangements, including the fair value of the investments  Additionally, if our investment in such companies\nbecomes impaired, we may need to re-evaluate the accounting for the commercial arrangement, including reducing any remaining performance\nobligations \nImpairment of Investments\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment  The credit loss is estimated by considering\navailable information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts  If we have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt\nsecurity in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the\ncorresponding charge as a component of OI&E \nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment indicators exist by evaluating\nthe companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among other indicators  If the assessment indicates that the\ninvestment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value by recording the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E  We\nprepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach  Depreciation commences once assets are ready for our intendeduse and is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate for factors such astechnological obsolescence and our planned use and utilization  We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives ofthe assets  For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair\nvalue allocation approach  We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the asset may be impaired  Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented  Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components  Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities \nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities \nThese amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and payments for maintenance and utilities  Our lease terms include periods under options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option  Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives \nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term  Finance lease expense\nis recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset, and interest expense is recognized based\non the incremental borrowing rate \nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable  If the carrying value of the assets or\nasset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value  We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law  We evaluate the\nlikelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred\ntax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax assets when it is\nmore likely than not that they will be realized  We have elected to account for the tax effects of the global intangible low tax income provision as\na current period expense \nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the position will\nbe sustained upon examination  In addition, we recognize interest and\npenalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision  We allocate the purchase price of the\nacquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, except for revenue contracts acquired, which are\nrecognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and\nliabilities is recorded as goodwill  We record translation\ngains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity  We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from\nthe conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&E  We will also be required to\ndisclose the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements  Upon adoption, we will be required to disclose in the\nnotes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain expense categories included within the expense captions on the face of the income\nstatement  See Note 15 for further details \nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform

classified within Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair\nvalue hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar\ninstruments in active markets \nDebt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to\nthe extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value  For certain marketable\ndebt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E  The fair value option was elected for\nthese securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts \nThe following

market comparable approach, and common stock\nequivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs\nincluding volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the rights and obligations of the securities we hold \nAs of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was

parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service\nproviders with respect to certain matters  We have agreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of\nrepresentations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties  Several of these\nagreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim  In addition, we have entered into\nindemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents  However, to the extent that valid indemnification\nclaims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or\ncash flows in a particular period \nAs of December 31, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible \nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial changes to our business\npractices and products, or structural remedies  The\noutcomes of outstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in\naggregate, have a material adverse effect , Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including the following:\n\u2022 Shopping: In June 2017, the EC announced its decision that

certain provisionsof EU's Digital Markets Act relating to Google Play and Search \nIn addition to these proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims pursued by regulatory authorities are\npending in the U \nWe believe we have strong arguments against these open claims and will defend ourselves vigorously \nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products,\nservices, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights  Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial\nmonetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities,

consent orders involving\ncompetition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content\ngenerated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and\nother matters  Such claims, consent\norders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief,\nongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and\ncollateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and\noperating results  The subject matter of non-\nincome tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these\njurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits  Due to the inherent complexity and\nuncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations \nShare Repurchases\nIn the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we continued to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a

\u2013 June 2025 \nMethodology: This report is based on a multi-method research design that includes \na systematic review of over 300 publicly disclosed AI initiatives, structured \ninterviews with representatives from 52 organizations, and survey responses from \n153 senior leaders collected across four major industry conferences  \n Disclaimer: The views expressed in this report are solely those of the authors and \nreviewers and do not reflect the positions of any affiliated employers  \n Confidentiality Note: All company-specific data and quotes have been \nanonymized to maintain compliance with corporate disclosure policies and \nconfidentiality agreements, ensure neutrality, and prevent any perception of \ncommercial advancement or opinion  The Wrong Side of the GenAI Divide: High Adoption, Low Transformation \n3  Crossing the GenAI Divide: How the Best Builders Succeed \n5  Crossing the GenAI Divide: How the Best Buyers Succeed \n6  Conclusion: Bridging the GenAI Divide \n2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nDespite $30\u201340 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \nresult in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return  The outcomes are so starkly \ndivided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \nconsultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide  Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \nmillions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact  Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \nand misalignment with day-to-day operations  \nFrom our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \nemerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n\u2022 Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n\u2022 Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n\u2022 Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n\u2022 Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \ninternal builds \n \nThe core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent  Most \nGenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time  \nWhile most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \ncrossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \nsupport, software engineering, and administrative functions  \n \n3 THE WRONG SIDE OF THE GENAI DIVIDE: HIGH ADOPTION, \nLOW TRANSFORMATION \nTakeaway: Most organizations fall on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, adoption is high, \nbut disruption is low  Enterprises are \npiloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment  \nThe GenAI Divide is most visible when examining industry-level transformation patterns 1 THE DISRUPTION REALITY BEHIND THE DIVIDE \nTakeaway: The GenAI Divide manifests clearly at the industry level, despite GenAI's \nvisibility, only two industries (Tech and Media) show clear signs of structural disruption, \nwhile seven others remain on the wrong side of transformation  \nDespite high-profile investment, industry-level transformation remains limited  GenAI has \nbeen embedded in support, content creation, and analytics use cases, but few industries \nshow the deep structural shifts associated with past general-purpose technologies such as \nnew market leaders, disrupted business models, or measurable changes in customer \nbehavior  \nTo better quantify the state of disruption, we developed a composite AI Market Disruption \nIndex  Market share volatility among top incumbents (2022 to 2025)  pg  Revenue growth of AI-native firms founded after 2020 \n3  Emergence of new AI-driven business models \n4  Changes in user behavior attributable to GenAI \n5  Frequency of executive org changes attributed to AI tooling \nExhibit: GenAI disruption varies sharply by industry \n \nExhibit: Description of GenAI disruption \nIndustry Key Signals \nTechnology New challengers gaining ground (e , Cursor vs Copilot); shifts in \nworkflows \nMedia & Telecom Rise of AI-native content; shifting ad dynamics; incumbents still \ngrowing \nProfessional Services Efficiency gains; client delivery remains largely unchanged \nHealthcare & Pharma Documentation/transcription pilots; clinical models unchanged \nConsumer & Retail Support automation; limited impact on loyalty or leaders \nFinancial Services Backend automation; customer relationships stable \nAdvanced Industries Maintenance pilots; no major supply chain shifts \nEnergy & Materials Near-zero adoption; minimal experimentation \n \n2\n1 5 4\nMedia & Telecom\nProfessional Services\nHealthcare & Pharma\nConsumer & Retail\nFinancial Services\nAdvanced Industries\nEnergy & Materials pg  \nTechnology and Media & Telecom maintained top rankings across all reasonable weighting \nschemes, while Healthcare and Energy remained consistently low 1 depending on \nemphasis placed on efficiency gains versus structural change  This gap between investment and disruption directly demonstrates the GenAI \nDivide at scale, widespread experimentation without transformation  One mid-market manufacturing COO \nsummarized the prevailing sentiment: \n\"The hype on LinkedIn says everything has changed, but in our operations, nothing \nfundamental has shifted 2 THE PILOT-TO-PRODUCTION CHASM \nTakeaway: The GenAI Divide is starkest in deployment rates, only 5% of custom enterprise \nAI tools reach production  Chatbots succeed because they're easy to try and flexible, but fail \nin critical workflows due to lack of memory and customization  This fundamental gap \nexplains why most organizations remain on the wrong side of the divide  \nOur research reveals a steep drop-off between investigations of GenAI adoption tools and \npilots and actual implementations, with significant variation between generic and custom \nsolutions  \nExhibit: The steep drop from pilots to production for task-specific GenAI tools reveals \nthe GenAI divide \n \n80%\n50%\n40%\n60%\n20% 5%\nInvestigated Piloted Successfully Implemented\nGeneral-Purpose LLMs Embedded or Task-Specific GenAI pg  7 \n \nResearch Note: We define successfully implemented for task-specific GenAI tools as ones \nusers or executives have remarked as causing a marked and sustained productivity and/or \nP&L impact \nThe 95% failure rate for enterprise AI solutions represents the clearest manifestation of the \nGenAI Divide  However, \nthis masks a deeper split in perceived value and reveals why most organizations remain \ntrapped on the wrong side of the divide  These systems were praised for flexibility, familiarity, \nand immediate utility  Yet the same users were overwhelmingly skeptical of custom or \nvendor-pitched AI tools, describing them as brittle, overengineered, or misaligned with \nactual workflows \" \nWhile enthusiasm and budgets are often sufficient to launch pilots, converting these into \nworkflow-integrated systems with persistent value remains rare, a pattern that defines the \nexperience of organizations on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide  \nEnterprises, defined here as firms with over $100 million in annual revenue, lead in pilot \ncount and allocate more staff to AI-related initiatives  \nBy contrast, mid-market companies moved faster and more decisively  \n \nFive Myths About GenAI in the Enterprise \n1  AI Will Replace Most Jobs in the Next Few Years \u2192 Research found limited \nlayoffs from GenAI, and only in industries that are already affected \nsignificantly by AI  Generative AI is Transforming Business \u2192 Adoption is high, but \ntransformation is rare  Only 5% of enterprises have AI tools integrated in \nworkflows at scale and 7 of 9 sectors show no real structural change  Enterprises are slow in adopting new tech \u2192 Enterprises are extremely eager \nto adopt AI and 90% have seriously explored buying an AI solution  The biggest thing holding back AI is model quality, legal, data, risk \u2192 What's \nreally holding it back is that most AI tools don't learn and don\u2019t integrate \nwell into workflows  The best enterprises are building their own tools \u2192 Internal builds fail twice as \noften 3 THE SHADOW AI ECONOMY: A BRIDGE ACROSS THE DIVIDE \nTakeaway: While official enterprise initiatives remain stuck on the wrong side of the GenAI \nDivide, employees are already crossing it through personal AI tools  This \"shadow AI\" often \ndelivers better ROI than formal initiatives and reveals what actually works for bridging the \ndivide  \nBehind the disappointing enterprise deployment numbers lies a surprising reality: AI is \nalready transforming work, just not through official channels  Our research uncovered a \nthriving \"shadow AI economy\" where employees use personal ChatGPT accounts, Claude \nsubscriptions, and other consumer tools to automate significant portions of their jobs, often \nwithout IT knowledge or approval  While only 40% of companies say they purchased an official LLM \nsubscription, workers from over 90% of the companies we surveyed reported regular use of \npersonal AI tools for work tasks  \nExhibit: the shadow AI economy, employee usage far outpaces official adoption\n \nIn many cases, shadow AI users reported using LLMs multiples times a day every day of \ntheir weekly workload through personal tools, while their companies' official AI initiatives \nremained stalled in pilot phase  \nThis shadow economy demonstrates that individuals can successfully cross the GenAI \nDivide when given access to flexible, responsive tools  The organizations that recognize this \npattern and build on it represent the future of enterprise AI adoption 4 INVESTMENT PATTERNS REFLECT THE DIVIDE \nTakeaway: Investment allocation reveals the GenAI Divide in action, 50% of GenAI budgets \ngo to sales and marketing, but back-office automation often yields better ROI  \nIn terms of functional focus, investment in GenAI tools is heavily concentrated  As GenAI \nspend is not yet formally quantified across organizations, we asked executives to allocate a \nhypothetical $100 to different functions  Sales and marketing functions captured \napproximately 70 percent of AI budget allocation across organizations in our survey  \nExhibit: GenAI Investment Distribution by Function \n \nAI-generated outbound emails\nSmart lead \nscoring\nPersonalized content for \ncampaigns\nFollow-up \nautomation\nAI-based competitor \nanalysis\nSocial sentiment \nanalysis\nInternal workflow \norchestration\nDocument

\ntagging\nSupplier \nrisk alerts\nAP/AR \nautomati\non\nSales & Marketing Operations\nCustomer Service Finance & \nProcurement pg  10 \n \nResearch Notes: While the general functional allocation of GenAI investment (e , ~50% to \nSales & Marketing) was relatively consistent across executive interviews, the sub-category and \nuse-case breakdowns should be treated as directional at best  For example, manufacturers and healthcare providers typically \ndirected minimal investment to Sales & Marketing and over-indexed on Operations  Tech and \nmedia firms often prioritized Marketing, Content, and Developer Productivity  \nSales and marketing dominate not only because of visibility, but because outcomes can be \nmeasured easily  Metrics such as demo volume or email response time align directly with \nboard-level KPIs \" \nThis investment bias perpetuates the GenAI Divide by directing resources toward visible but \noften less transformative use cases, while the highest-ROI opportunities in back-office \nfunctions remain underfunded  \nBeyond measurement challenges, trust and social proof remain decisive in purchase \ndecisions  A Head of Procurement at a major CPG firm captured the dilemma many buyers \nface: \n\"I receive numerous emails daily claiming to offer the best GenAI solution  Referrals, prior \nrelationships, and VC introductions remain stronger predictors of enterprise adoption than \nfunctionality or feature set  \n4 WHY PILOTS STALL: THE LEARNING GAP BEHIND THE DIVIDE \nThe primary factor keeping organizations on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide is the \nlearning gap, tools that don't learn, integrate poorly, or match workflows 1 THE BARRIERS KEEPING ORGANIZATIONS TRAPPED \nTakeaway: The top barriers reflect the fundamental learning gap that defines the GenAI \nDivide: users resist tools that don't adapt, model quality fails without context, and UX suffers \nwhen systems can't remember  Even avid ChatGPT users distrust internal GenAI tools that \ndon't match their expectations  \nTo understand why so few GenAI pilots progress beyond the experimental phase, we \nsurveyed both executive sponsors and frontline users across 52 organizations  \nExhibit: Why GenAI pilots fail: top barriers to scaling AI in the enterprise \nUsers were asked to rate each issue on a scale of 1-10 \n \nResearch Note: These scores reflect reported frequency rather than objective \nmeasurement of barrier impact, and may vary significantly by industry and organization size  Consumer \nadoption of ChatGPT and similar tools has surged, with over 40% of knowledge workers \nusing AI tools personally  This \nparadox illustrates the GenAI Divide at the user level  The same professionals using ChatGPT daily \nfor personal tasks demand learning and memory capabilities for enterprise work  A \nsignificant number of workers already use AI tools privately, reporting productivity gains, \nwhile their companies' formal AI initiatives stall  This shadow usage creates a feedback loop: \nemployees know what good AI feels like, making them less tolerant of static enterprise \ntools 2 WHY GENERIC TOOLS WIN, AND LOSE \nTakeaway: The GenAI Divide manifests in user preferences: ChatGPT beats enterprise tools \nbecause it's better, faster, and more familiar, even when both use similar models  But this \nsame preference exposes why organizations remain stuck on the wrong side of the divide  The professionals expressing \nskepticism about enterprise AI tools were often heavy users of consumer LLM interfaces  Her organization invested \n$50,000 in a specialized contract analysis tool, yet she consistently defaulted to ChatGPT \nfor drafting work: \n\"Our purchased AI tool provided rigid summaries with limited customization options  The \nfundamental quality difference is noticeable, ChatGPT consistently produces better outputs, \neven though our vendor claims to use the same underlying technology  This paradox exemplifies why most organizations \nremain on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide 3 THE LEARNING GAP THAT DEFINES THE DIVIDE \nTakeaway: ChatGPT's very limitations reveal the core issue behind the GenAI Divide: it \nforgets context, doesn't learn, and can't evolve  The gap is structural, GenAI lacks memory and adaptability  The barriers here proved distinct from general \nusability concerns and directly illuminated the learning gap that defines the GenAI Divide  13 \n \n \nThe same lawyer who favored ChatGPT for initial drafts drew a clear line at sensitive \ncontracts: \n\"It's excellent for brainstorming and first drafts, but it doesn't retain knowledge of client \npreferences or learn from previous edits \" \nThis feedback points to the fundamental learning gap that keeps organizations on the \nwrong side of the GenAI Divide  \nWhen we asked enterprise users to rate different options for high-stakes work, the \npreference hierarchy became clear: \nExhibit: Perceived Fitness for High-Stakes Work  \n\"Would you assign this task to AI or a junior colleague?\" \n \nThe results reveal that AI has already won the war for simple work, 70% prefer AI for drafting \nemails, 65% for basic analysis  The dividing line isn't intelligence, it's memory, adaptability, and learning \ncapability, the exact characteristics that separate the two sides of the GenAI Divide \"\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70%\n70%\n10%\n30%\n90%\nQuick tasks (emails, summaries, basic analysis)\nComplex projects (multi-week work, client\nmanagement)\nAI Preferred Human Preferred pg  14 \n \nAgentic AI, the class of systems that embeds persistent memory and iterative learning by \ndesign, directly addresses the learning gap that defines the GenAI Divide  Unlike current \nsystems that require full context each time, agentic systems maintain persistent memory, \nlearn from interactions, and can autonomously orchestrate complex workflows  \n \nExhibit: Positioning GenAI tools by customization and learning capability \n Low Memory / Learning High Memory / Learning \nLow Customization Copilot, GPT wrappers ChatGPT w/ memory (beta) \nHigh Customization Internal builds (fragile) Agentic workflows, vertical SaaS \n5 CROSSING THE GENAI DIVIDE: HOW THE BEST BUILDERS \nSUCCEED \nOrganizations on the right side of the GenAI Divide share a common approach: they build \nadaptive, embedded systems that learn from feedback  Domain fluency and workflow \nintegration matter more than flashy UX  \nAcross our interviews, we observed a growing divergence among GenAI startups  Some are \nstruggling with outdated SaaS playbooks and remain trapped on the wrong side of the \ndivide, while others are capturing enterprise attention through aggressive customization \nand alignment with real business pain points  \nThe appetite for GenAI tools remains high  \nOur data reveals a clear pattern: the organizations and vendors succeeding are those \naggressively solving for learning, memory, and workflow adaptation, while those failing are \neither building generic tools or trying to develop capabilities internally  \nWinning startups build systems that learn from feedback (66% of executives want this), \nretain context (63% demand this), and customize deeply to specific workflows 1 WHAT ENTERPRISES ACTUALLY WANT: THE BRIDGE ACROSS THE DIVIDE \nThe most successful vendors understand that crossing the GenAI Divide requires building \nsystems that executives repeatedly emphasized: AI systems that do not just generate \ncontent, but learn and improve within their environment   \nWhen evaluating AI tools, buyers consistently emphasized a specific set of priorities  We \ncoded these themes across interviews to quantify how often they surfaced in procurement \ndecisions: \nExhibit: How executives select GenAI vendors \nDerived from interviews and coded by category  \n \nExhibit: Direct quotes on executives selecting GenAI vendors \nDerived from interviews and coded by category  \n \nWhat They Want Direct Quotes  \nA vendor we (they) trust \"We're more likely to wait for our existing partner to add AI \nthan gamble on a startup  If the AI can't adapt, \nwe're back to spreadsheets  Most users \nwelcomed automation, especially for tedious, manual tasks, as long as data remained \nsecure and outcomes were measurable  \nDespite conventional wisdom that enterprises resist training AI systems, most teams in our \ninterviews expressed willingness to do so, provided the benefits were clear and guardrails \nwere in place  \nDespite interest in AI, there is notable skepticism toward emerging vendors, especially in \nhigh-trust or regulated workflows  Many procurement leaders told us they ignore most \nstartup pitches, regardless of innovation  \n\"We receive dozens of pitches daily about AI-powered procurement tools  We're more likely to \nwait for their AI-enhanced version than switch to an unknown vendor 2 THE WINNING PLAYBOOK FOR CROSSING THE DIVIDE \nTakeaway: Startups that successfully cross the GenAI Divide land small, visible wins in \nnarrow workflows, then expand  Channel referrals and peer trust are key growth levers \nfor bridging the divide  Tools that succeeded \nshared two traits: low configuration burden and immediate, visible value  \nSuccessful categories from our sample included: \n\u2022 Voice AI for call summarization and routing \n\u2022 Document automation for contracts and forms \n\u2022 Code generation for repetitive engineering tasks \nStruggling categories were often those involving complex internal logic, opaque decision \nsupport, or optimization based on proprietary heuristics  \nSome startups have excelled by dominating small but critical workflows, especially in sales \nand marketing, and then expanding  Top-quartile GenAI startups are reaching $1  17 \n \n \nNarrow Scope Broad Scope \nSimple \nExecution \nFast wins (Spend Categorization, \nContract Review) \nPartial pilots (Supplier Risk

CROSS THE DIVIDE \nTakeaway: The window for crossing the GenAI Divide is rapidly closing  Agentic AI and memory frameworks (like NANDA and \nMCP) will define which vendors help organizations cross the divide versus remain trapped \non the wrong side  OpenAI's \nChatGPT memory beta signals similar expectations in general-purpose tools  These protocols create market competition and cost \nefficiencies by allowing specialized agents to work together rather than requiring monolithic \nsystems  Organizations investing in AI systems that learn from their data, \nworkflows, and feedback are creating switching costs that compound monthly  \n\"We're currently evaluating five different GenAI solutions, but whichever system best learns and \nadapts to our specific processes will ultimately win our business  Once we've invested time in \ntraining a system to understand our workflows, the switching costs become prohibitive \" - CIO, \n$5B Financial Services Firm \n6 CROSSING THE GENAI DIVIDE: HOW THE BEST BUYERS \nSUCCEED \nOrganizations that successfully cross the GenAI Divide approach AI procurement differently, \nthey act like BPO clients, not SaaS customers  \nAcross our interviews, one insight was clear: the most effective AI-buying organizations no \nlonger wait for perfect use cases or central approval  \nThis gap explains why ChatGPT dominates for ad-hoc tasks but fails at critical workflows, \nand why generic enterprise tools lose to both consumer LLMs and deeply customized \nalternatives 1 ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN FOR CROSSING THE DIVIDE \nTakeaway: The right organizational structure is critical for crossing the GenAI Divide  \nThe dominant barrier to crossing the GenAI Divide is not integration or budget, it is \norganizational design  Our data shows that companies succeed when they decentralize \nimplementation authority but retain accountability  \nWe observed three primary team structures for GenAI implementation, with materially \ndifferent outcomes that reflect which side of the divide organizations land on  \n % of Deployments  \nStrategic \nPartnerships \n(Buy) \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 66% Procure external tools, co-\ndevelop with vendors \nInternal

quantify Internal team co-develops with \nan external vendor \nResearch Limitations: These percentages reflect our interview sample of 52 organizations and \nmay not represent broader market patterns  Companies avoided the overhead of building from \nscratch, while still achieving tailored solutions  Organizations that understand this pattern \nposition themselves to cross the GenAI Divide more effectively 2 BUYER PRACTICES THAT CROSS THE DIVIDE \nAcross interviews, a consistent pattern emerged among organizations successfully crossing \nthe GenAI Divide: top buyers treated AI startups less like software vendors and more like \nbusiness service providers, holding them to benchmarks closer to those used for consulting \nfirms or BPOs  These organizations: \n\u2022 Demanded deep customization aligned to internal processes and data \n\u2022 Benchmarked tools on operational outcomes, not model benchmarks \n\u2022 Partnered through early-stage failures, treating deployment as co-evolution \n\u2022 Sourced AI initiatives from frontline managers, not central labs \nIn this last pattern, individual contributors and team managers often played a critical role  \nThese \"prosumers\" intuitively understood GenAI's capabilities and limits, and became early \nchampions of internally sanctioned solutions  Rather than relying on a centralized AI \nfunction to identify use cases, successful organizations allowed budget holders and domain \nmanagers to surface problems, vet tools, and lead rollouts  This bottom-up sourcing, paired \nwith executive accountability, accelerated adoption while preserving operational fit 3 WHERE THE REAL ROI LIVES: BEYOND THE DIVIDE \nTakeaway: Organizations that cross the GenAI Divide discover that ROI is often highest in \nignored functions like operations and finance  Real gains come from replacing BPOs and \nexternal agencies, not cutting internal staff  \nDespite 50% of AI budgets flowing to sales and marketing (from the theoretical estimate \nwith executives), some of the most dramatic cost savings we documented came from back-\noffice automation  While front-office gains are visible and board-friendly, the back-office \ndeployments often delivered faster payback periods and clearer cost reductions  21 \n \n\u2022 Lead qualification speed: 40% faster \n\u2022 Customer retention: 10% improvement through AI-powered follow-ups and \nmessaging \nBack-office wins: \n\u2022 BPO elimination: $2-10M annually in customer service and document processing \n\u2022 Agency spend reduction: 30% decrease in external creative and content costs \n\u2022 Risk checks for financial services: $1M saved annually on outsourced risk \nmanagement \nNotably, these gains came without material workforce reduction  Instead, ROI emerged from reduced \nexternal spend, eliminating BPO contracts, cutting agency fees, and replacing expensive \nconsultants with AI-powered internal capabilities  \nThe pattern suggests that while sales and marketing capture the majority of attention and \ninvestment, back-office automation may offer more dramatic and sustainable returns for \norganizations willing to look beyond the obvious use cases and truly cross the GenAI Divide 4 THE JOB IMPACT REALITY: WHAT CROSSING THE DIVIDE ACTUALLY MEANS \nTakeaway: GenAI is already starting to have workforce impact and it is manifesting through \nselective displacement of previously outsourced functions and constrained hiring patterns, \nbut not through broad-based layoffs  Organizations that have crossed the GenAI Divide \ndemonstrate measurable external cost reduction while slightly decreasing internal \nheadcount 1 Displacement Patterns and Organizational Strategy \nOur analysis reveals that GenAI-driven workforce reductions concentrate in functions \nhistorically treated as non-core business activities: customer support operations, \nadministrative processing, and standardized development tasks  These roles exhibited \nvulnerability prior to AI implementation due to their outsourced status and process \nstandardization  Executives were hesitant to reveal the scope of layoffs due to AI but it was \nbetween 5-20% of customer support operations and administrative processing work in \nthese companies   \nIndustry-specific hiring expectations reveal a clear correlation with GenAI impact patterns  \nIn sectors showing minimal structural disruption from AI, Healthcare, Energy, Advanced \nIndustries, most executives report no current or anticipated hiring reductions over the next \nfive years  \nConversely, in Technology and Media sectors where GenAI has demonstrated measurable \nimpact, >80% of executives anticipate reduced hiring volumes within 24 months  22 \n \nCritical finding: This dynamic remains concentrated among advanced AI adopters, and only \nin industries that are currently experiencing significant disruption with GenAI (tech, media) 2 Evolving Hiring Criteria and Skills Requirements \nGenAI adoption creates divergent hiring strategies across organizations  While executives \ndemonstrate no consensus regarding entry-level or general hiring volumes, they \nconsistently emphasize AI literacy as a fundamental capability requirement  This reflects \norganizational recognition that AI proficiency represents a competitive advantage in \nworkflow optimization  \n\"Our hiring strategy prioritizes candidates who demonstrate AI tool proficiency \" - VP of Operations, Mid-\nMarket Manufacturing \n6 3 trillion in labor value affecting 39 million positions \nThis latent exposure becomes actionable as AI systems develop persistent memory, \ncontinuous learning, and autonomous tool integration, capabilities that define crossing the \nGenAI Divide  Until AI systems achieve contextual adaptation and autonomous operation, \norganizational impact will manifest through external cost optimization rather than internal \nrestructuring 5 BEYOND AGENTS: THE AGENTIC WEB \nTakeaway: The next evolution beyond individual AI agents is an agentic web where \nautonomous systems can discover, negotiate, and coordinate across the entire \ninternet infrastructure, fundamentally changing how business processes operate  In an \nagentic web, systems will autonomously discover optimal vendors and evaluate \nsolutions without human research, establish dynamic API integrations in real-time \nwithout pre-built connectors, execute trustless transactions through blockchain-\nenabled smart contracts, and develop emergent workflows that self-optimize \nacross multiple platforms and organizational boundaries  This represents a fundamental shift from today's human-mediated \nbusiness processes to autonomous systems that operate across the entire internet \necosystem, moving well beyond the current GenAI Divide to reshape how \norganizations discover, integrate, and transact in a networked economy  \n7 CONCLUSION: BRIDGING THE GENAI DIVIDE \nOrganizations that successfully cross the GenAI Divide do three things differently: they buy \nrather than build, empower line managers rather than central labs, and select tools that \nintegrate deeply while adapting over time  \nThis transition marks not just a shift in tooling, but the emergence of an Agentic Web: a \npersistent, interconnected layer of learning systems that collaborate across vendors, \ndomains, and interfaces  As enterprises begin locking in vendor relationships and feedback loops \nthrough 2026, the window to cross the GenAI Divide is rapidly narrowing  \nThe shift from building to buying, combined with the rise of prosumer adoption and the \nemergence of agentic capabilities, creates unprecedented opportunities for vendors who \ncan deliver learning-capable, deeply integrated AI systems  The organizations and vendors \nthat recognize and act on these patterns will establish the dominant positions in the post-\npilot AI economy, on the right side of the GenAI Divide  The GenAI \nDivide is not permanent, but crossing it requires fundamentally different choices about \ntechnology, partnerships, and organizational design  Our research focuses on translating AI capabilities into measurable business \noutcomes across enterprise and mid-market organizations 2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND LIMITATIONS \nMethodology: 52 structured interviews across enterprise stakeholders, systematic analysis \nof 300+ public AI initiatives and announcements, and surveys with 153 leaders  \nSample Limitations: \n\u2022 Our sample may not fully represent all enterprise segments or geographic regions \n\u2022 Organizations willing to discuss AI implementation challenges may systematically \ndiffer from those declining participation, potentially creating bias toward either more \nexperimental or more cautious adopters \n\u2022 Selection bias possible in organizations willing to participate in AI research \n\u2022 Success metrics vary significantly across organizations and industries, limiting direct \ncomparisons \nMethodological Constraints: \n\u2022 Industry disruption scores reflect publicly observable patterns and may not capture \nprivate or emerging developments \n\u2022 Build vs  buy percentages based on interview responses rather than comprehensive \nmarket data \n\u2022 ROI measurements complicated by concurrent operational improvements and \nexternal economic factors \n\u2022 Six-month observation period may be insufficient to fully assess \"successful \ndeployment\" for complex enterprise systems, potentially understating success rates \nfor longer-term implementations \nExternal Factors Not Fully Addressed: \n\u2022 Regulatory constraints affecting adoption \n8  25 \n \n\u2022 Functional

statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K other than\nstatements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans, and our\nobjectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements  We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current\nexpectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-\nterm and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs  These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties\nand assumptions, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K  It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact\nof all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in\nany forward-looking statements we may make  In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking\nstatements \nWe undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law  Given\nthese risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward\u2011looking statements  We report our estimates of the\nnumbers of our daily active people (DAP) and average revenue per person (ARPP) (collectively, our \"Family metrics\") based on the activity of users who\nvisited at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) during the applicable period of measurement  These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are\nsubject to statistical variances and uncertainties \nTo calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples\nof user accounts and calibrated against user survey data  We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which survey questions are\nbased on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error  In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain\ndetails of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates  From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make\nproduct changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular\nperiod  Our vision does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of experiences, devices, and new technologies \nAcross our work, we are innovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more social, useful,\nand immersive  Our AI investments support initiatives across our products and services, helping power the systems that rank content in our apps, our discovery\nengine that recommends relevant content, the tools advertisers use to reach customers, the development of new generative AI experiences, and the tools that\nmake our product development more efficient and productive  For example, Meta AI is an assistant that's available across our apps, on Ray-Ban Meta AI\nglasses and on the web  Currently, we generate substantially all of our revenue from\nselling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is reflected in FoA  Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a\nrange of marketing objectives, such as generating leads or driving awareness  Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites  In 2025, we intend to focus on several key investment areas: generative AI, our discovery\nengine, the metaverse and wearables, Threads, monetization of our products and services, platform integrity and community support, and infrastructure\ncapacity  They can do this through Feed, Reels, Stories, Groups, Marketplace, and more \nReality Labs Products\nMany of our Reality Labs investments are directed toward long-term, cutting edge research and development for products that are not on the market\ntoday and may only be fully realized in the next decade  This includes exploring new technologies such as neural interfaces using electromyography, which lets\npeople control their devices using neuromuscular signals, as well as innovations in AI and hardware to help build next-generation interfaces  Our current product offerings in VR include our Meta Quest devices, as well\nas software and content available through the Meta Horizon Store, which enable a range of social experiences that allow people to defy physical distance while\nengaging in gaming, fitness, entertainment, and more  We have continued to advance our roadmap to include additional AI-enabled offerings such as the Ray-\nBan Meta AI glasses, which feature Meta AI, our advanced conversational assistant, as well as other features such as hands-free interaction  As we continue our\nlong-term efforts to bring AR glasses to market, in 2024 we also unveiled our Orion prototype, a pair of true AR glasses that overlay content on top of the\nphysical world \nIn general, while all of these investments are part of our long-term initiative to help build the next computing platform, our metaverse efforts also\ninclude notable shorter-term projects developing specific products and services to go to market, whereas our wearables efforts are primarily directed toward\nlonger-term research and development projects  For example, in 2025, we expect to spend approximately 50% of our Reality Labs operating expenses on our\nwearables initiatives, and the remaining 50% on our metaverse initiatives  We apply significant judgment in estimating this expense breakdown as there are\ncertain shared costs across product lines, and our expectations are subject to change, including as the next computing platform and our business strategies\nevolve  In particular, we regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and\nmarket landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve \n7 Table of Contents\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies  We compete with companies providing connection, sharing,\ndiscovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or\ndevelop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns  We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but\nnot limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to\nreach their existing or prospective audiences  We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use\nour free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate with our products  We also expect to\nface additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and\nservices, including as part of efforts to innovate through the development and application of AI and other new technologies as well as efforts to develop the\nmetaverse \nTechnology\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design, which means that\nour products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience  Our ability to provide and continue to innovate our products and services depends on the continued availability of components, power, and network\ncapacity \nWe make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our marketers\nand developers  We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen\nour systems against abuse  Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things,\nrecommend relevant content across our products through our AI-powered discovery engine, enhance our advertising tools and improve our ad delivery,\ntargeting, and measurement capabilities, and to develop new products as well as new features for existing products \nWe also believe in the power of open source innovation and have released our Llama models, consisting of state-of-the-art foundation models that are\navailable for researchers and developers to use and build upon  By making our Llama models openly available, we aim to accelerate AI research and\ndevelopment, improve our own products, and to foster collaboration and innovation within the broader tech community \nSales and Operations\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns  We also have a global sales force that\nis focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-\nmaking to real-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics \nFor our RL products, our sales and operations efforts utilize third-party sales channels such as retailers, resellers, and our direct-to-consumer channel,\nMeta  These efforts are focused on driving consumer and enterprise sales and adoption of our Meta Quest portfolio of products and Ray-Ban Meta AI\nglasses \nMarketing\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them, supported by internal efforts to\nstimulate awareness and interest  In addition, we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help\nbuild community around the world  These laws and regulations involve matters including\nprivacy, data use, data combination, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of\npublicity, content, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage,\ndata disclosure, AI and machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights,\naccessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political\nlaw compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services  The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions,\nor other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny  As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws\nand regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\ninconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices  For example, regulatory or legislative actions or\nlitigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in\nvarious ways, including for advertising, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, have in the past and could in the future\nadversely affect user growth and engagement, affect the manner in which we provide our services, or adversely affect our financial results, including by\nimposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue  Supreme Court heard oral\nargument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230)\nwas at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision  In addition, there have been, and continue to be, various other litigation\nconcerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the protections available to online platforms under\nSection 230, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could\nadversely affect our business and financial results \nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain\ndata that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services  Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May\n12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic\nArea (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union\nto organizations in the United States that are included in the \"Data Privacy Framework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the United States\nDepartment of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U  DPF by the CJEU could create considerable uncertainty\nand lead to us being unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations  As a\nresult, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant\nuncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our operations  The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA), also establishes certain transparency\nrules and creates certain data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to\ncontrol the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties  These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our\nadvertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising\nbusiness  Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and\nservices provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting our advertising business  For example, in response to regulatory\ndevelopments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European\nEconomic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no\nads\" alternative  We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, Digital Markets\nAct (DMA), and EU consumer laws  In addition, the European Data Protection\nBoard has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have raised concerns regarding\nour compliance with consumer protection laws  These or any similar developments in the future may negatively impact our\nuser growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results  The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements are enforceable against designated\ngatekeeper companies as of March 2024  Further, the Digital Services Act (DSA), which started to apply to\nour business as of August 2023, imposes certain restrictions and requirements for our products and services, subjects us to increased compliance costs, and\nincludes significant penalties for non-compliance  The interpretation and enforcement of the DMA and the DSA, as well as the imposition and amount of\npenalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty  In addition, some countries, such as the UK, India, and Turkey, are considering or have\npassed legislation implementing data protection requirements, new competition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar\nrequirements that could require substantial changes to our products, increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering\nof our products and services in certain countries, and/or result in fines or other penalties  New legislation or regulatory decisions may restrict our ability to\ncollect and use information about minors or also limit our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions  While enforcement of a number of these statutes (or parts of\nthem) has been enjoined as a result of legal challenges to them, it is possible that the decisions to enjoin these statutes may be overturned, the injunctive orders\nmay expire, and certain statutes are coming into effect that may not be subject to injunctions  Should enforcement of one or more of these statutes not be\nenjoined, we may not be able to comply with certain of these statutes by their respective effective dates  We may face similar challenges in light of recent\nlegislation in Australia which imposes a social media ban for users under 16 years old that is expected to be effective by December 2025, requiring certain\nsocial media companies to take reasonable steps to ensure under 16 year olds do not create user accounts \nWe are and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government\nauthorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use, data combination, and data\nprotection, including with respect to processing of sensitive data, data from third parties, data for advertising purposes, data security, minors, data subject\nrights, safety, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content and content moderation, use of our platform for illegal, illicit, or

risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects  These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to,\nrisks related to:\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\n\u2022 our ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;\n\u2022 the loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;\n\u2022 reduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;\n\u2022 ineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners;\n\u2022 failure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\n\u2022 our ability to compete effectively;\n\u2022 fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u2022 unfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;\n\u2022 our ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in our service, catastrophic events, and\ncrises;\n\u2022 operating our business in multiple countries around the world;\n\u2022 litigation, including class action lawsuits;\n\u2022 acquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\n\u2022 government restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to sell or deliver advertising, in their\ncountries;\n\u2022 complex and evolving U  and foreign privacy, data use, data combination, data protection, content and content moderation, competition, youth,\nsafety, consumer protection, advertising, and other laws and regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Digital\nMarkets Act (DMA), Digital Services Act (DSA), Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act), and the UK Digital Markets, Competition and\nConsumer Act (DMCC);\n\u2022 the impact of government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, including litigation and investigations by privacy, consumer\nprotection, and competition authorities, among others;\n14 Table of Contents\n\u2022 our ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the Federal Trade Commission\n(FTC);\nRisks Related to Data, Security, Platform Integrity, and Intellectual Property\n\u2022 the occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber incidents, as well as intentional\nmisuse of our

of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock by our founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n(CEO) \nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products, our revenue, financial results, and\nbusiness may be significantly harmed  Our financial performance has been\nand will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions,\nparticularly for Facebook and Instagram  We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user\nbase in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates  User growth and engagement are also\nimpacted by a number of other factors, including competitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our\nproducts and services, as well as global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions  In addition, in\nconnection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and these services were then prohibited by the Russian\ngovernment, which contributed to slight decreases in the size of our active user base following the onset of the war \nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or\nincrease the frequency and duration of their engagement  Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement,\nincluding if:\n\u2022 users increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\n\u2022 we fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services, or make changes to\nexisting products and services, that are not favorably received;\n\u2022 users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence, format, size, and\nquality of ads that we display;\n\u2022 users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we\nrely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\n\u2022 user behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on our products and services;\n\u2022 we are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety of mobile operating systems\nand networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\n15 Table of Contents\n\u2022 there are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our user data practices, concerns about the\nnature of content made available on our products, or concerns related to privacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;\n\u2022 we are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is appropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant\nto them;\n\u2022 we are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;\n\u2022 we are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our products;\n\u2022 users adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may not be featured or otherwise\navailable;\n\u2022 there are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely affect our products or users;\n\u2022 we are unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, or are otherwise\nlimited in our business operations, as a result of European courts invalidating the EU-U  DPF or regulators, courts, or legislative bodies\ndetermining that the legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States are invalid;\n\u2022 there is decreased engagement with our products, decreased efficiency of our advertising products, or failure to accept our terms of service, as\npart of changes that we have implemented or may implement in the future, whether voluntarily, in connection with the GDPR, the European\nUnion's ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, the DMCC, U  state privacy laws including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended\nby the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA), youth social media laws, or other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, or otherwise;\n\u2022 technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience, such as\nsecurity breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or otherwise objectionable content, or users feel their experience is diminished as a result of\nour efforts to protect the security and integrity of our platform;\n\u2022 we adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or we take, or fail to take, actions to\nenforce our policies, that result in our removal of users from our platform or are perceived negatively by our users or the general public, including\nas a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board regarding content on our platform;\n\u2022 we elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth and engagement (for example, we\nhave announced plans to focus product decisions on optimizing the young adult experience in the long term);\u2022 we make changes in our user account login or registration processes or changes in how we promote different products and services across ourfamily of products;\n\u2022 initiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement, including the use of evolving technologies such as generative artificial\nintelligence, are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result of actions by us, our competitors, or other third parties, or otherwise;\n\u2022 third-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans, are scaled back or discontinued, or\nthe pricing of data plans otherwise increases;\n\u2022 there is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other mobile applications in certain\ncountries, internet shutdowns, or other actions by governments that affect the accessibility of our products in their countries (for example,\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2022, our user growth and engagement were adversely affected by the war in Ukraine and service restrictions\nimposed by the Russian government);\n\u2022 we fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;\n16 Table of Contents\n\u2022 we, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry are the subject of adverse media\nreports or other negative publicity, including as a result of our or their user data practices; or\n\u2022 our current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers to build, grow, and\nmonetize applications, reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for our users to interact and share on third-party applications \nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to varying degrees  If we are unable to\nmaintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our significant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue\nand financial results may be adversely affected  Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive to\nusers, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our ability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations  As the size of our active user base fluctuates in one or more markets from time to time, we will become\nincreasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to grow revenue  The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by marketers, could seriously harm our\nbusiness \nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from marketers advertising on Facebook and Instagram  As is common in the industry, our\nmarketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us  Many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising\nbudget with us  Marketers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in\nan effective manner, if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives, or if they\nare not satisfied for any other reason  If we\nare unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the demand for our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and\nfinancial results may be harmed \nOur advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\n\u2022 decreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\n\u2022 our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\n\u2022 product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence of ads\ndisplayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products;\n\u2022 our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\n\u2022 our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\n\u2022 changes to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising,\nincluding changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\n\u2022 adverse litigation, government actions, or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to advertising, including developments that\nmay impact certain advertisers' ability to advertise on our platform or our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;\n\u2022 user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we monetize at a higher rate, such as our Feed and Stories\nproducts, including as a result of increased usage of our Reels or other video or messaging products;\n\u2022 reductions of advertising due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the security and integrity of our platform or\nthat we believe are needed to comply with global content, security, or integrity obligations;\n17 Table of Contents\n\u2022 the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of\nour ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\n\u2022 loss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if competitors offer lower priced, more\nintegrated, or otherwise more effective products;\n\u2022 limitations on our ability to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe as a result\nof European courts invalidating the EU-U  DPF or regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that the legal bases we rely upon to\ntransfer user data from the European Union to the United States are invalid;\n\u2022 limitations on our ability to deliver ads to users under the age of 18 and, in some cases, to continue to offer certain products or services to certain\ncohorts of users, whether voluntarily, as a result of new laws, regulations, or government actions in the United States and other jurisdictions, or\notherwise;\n\u2022 changes in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of risks related to complying with laws\nor regulatory requirements or other government actions;\n\u2022 decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of announcements by us or adverse media reports or other negative publicity\ninvolving us, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our products, our interpretation, implementation, or enforcement\nof policies relating to content on our products (including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board),\ndevelopers with applications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022 reductions of advertising by marketers due to illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable content made available on our products by third parties,\nquestions about our user data practices or the security of our platform, concerns about brand safety or potential legal liability, or uncertainty\nregarding regulatory developments or their own legal and compliance obligations, including with respect to artificial intelligence;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users consent to, opt out of, or reduce the use of data for ads, including as a result of\nproduct changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA,\nDMCC, U  state privacy laws including the CCPA, and other laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or litigation, or otherwise, that impact our\nability to use data for advertising purposes (for example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we began offering our users a\n\"subscription for no ads\" alternative in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland, and subsequently in November 2024\nprovided users in those regions who elect to continue receiving our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized\nads);\n\u2022 the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;\n\u2022 changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;\n\u2022 the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;\n\u2022 changes in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and\n\u2022 the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among specific types of marketers or\nwithin particular geographies, which in turn can have broader effects in other regions (for example, the war in Ukraine and service restrictions\nimposed by the Russian government have adversely affected our advertising business in Europe and other regions, and advertiser spending also\ncan be subject to adverse effects from conflicts in the Middle East or the implementation of tariffs by the United States, China, or other\ngovernments) \nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees  The occurrence of any of these or other\nfactors in the future, including our enforcement efforts, could result in a reduction in marketer spend or demand for our ads, which may reduce the prices we\nreceive for our ads, could cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether, or could otherwise negatively affect our revenue and financial results, and\ncould be material \n18 Table of Contents\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, as well as signals\ngenerated within our products, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-party mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have\nimpacted, and we expect will continue to impact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue  In particular, we have seen increases in the\nnumber of users opting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy\nDirective compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA  state privacy laws, such as the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, and the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, are introducing\nadditional rights for users and could result in restrictions on our use of signals from third-party apps and websites through certain browser- and device-based\nuniversal opt-out mechanisms  For\nexample, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and\nInstagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began\noffering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative  In addition, the\nEuropean Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have\nraised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws \nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future\nplans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising  For example, in 2021, Apple\nmade certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers'\nability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers\nare willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms  For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS\nchanges beginning in 2021 \nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies,\nproducts, and standards that we do not control  We may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that\noperate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards  In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use our\nproducts on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use our products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access\nto our products, our user growth and user engagement could be harmed  In the event that our users are adversely affected by\nthese actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and our\nbusiness could be harmed  We have experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that\nwe do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which\nmay in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results \nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits, or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness \nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing\nproducts and to create successful new products, both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties  For example, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed\nreality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these evolving products and technologies  We are also making\nsignificant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives across our business  For example, we continue to launch new AI features on our products,\nincluding support for new modalities, conversational AIs, stickers and photos, and editing tools \nIf our new products or changes to existing products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail\nto attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely\naffected \nWe are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things, recommend relevant content across our\nproducts, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products  In particular, we expect our AI initiatives will\nrequire increased investment in infrastructure and headcount \n20 Table of Contents\nThere are significant risks involved in developing and deploying AI and there can be no assurance that the usage of AI will enhance our products or\nservices or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability  For example, our AI-related efforts, particularly those related to generative AI,\nsubject us to risks related to harmful or illegal content, accuracy, misinformation and deepfakes (including related to elections), bias, discrimination, toxicity,\nconsumer protection, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and sanctions and export controls, among\nothers  It is also uncertain how various laws related to online services, intermediary liability, and other issues will apply to content generated by AI  In addition,\nwe are subject to the risks of new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other legal liability, ethical concerns, negative consumer\nperceptions as to automation and AI, activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline, or other complications that could adversely affect our\nbusiness, reputation, or financial results \nAs a result of the complexity and rapid development of AI, it is also the subject of evolving review by various governmental and regulatory agencies in\njurisdictions around the world, which are applying, or are considering applying, platform moderation, intellectual property, cybersecurity, export controls, and\ndata protection laws to AI and/or are considering general legal frameworks on AI (such as the recently passed EU AI Act)  We may not always be able to\nanticipate how courts and regulators will apply existing laws to AI, predict how new legal frameworks will develop to address AI, or otherwise respond to these\nframeworks as they are still rapidly evolving  We may also have to expend resources to adapt to new legal frameworks, and adjust our offerings in certain\njurisdictions if the legal frameworks on AI are not consistent across jurisdictions \nFurther, we face significant competition from other companies that are developing their own AI features and technologies  Other companies may\ndevelop AI features and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or are more cost-effective to develop and deploy  Given the long history of\ndevelopment in the AI sector, other parties may have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with\nour ability to make, use, or sell our own AI features  Our AI initiatives also depend on our access to data to effectively train our models  Further, our ability to\ncontinue to develop and effectively deploy AI technologies is dependent on access to specific third-party equipment and other technical and physical\ninfrastructure, such as processing hardware, network capacity, computing power, and related energy requirements, as to which we cannot control the\navailability or pricing, especially in a highly competitive environment \nWe are also developing AI technology that we make available via open source, commercial, and non-commercial license agreements to third-parties that\ncan use this technology for use in their own products and services  We may not have insight into, or control over, the practices of third parties who may utilize\nsuch AI technologies  As such, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not use such AI technologies for improper purposes, including through the\ndissemination of illegal, inaccurate, defamatory or harmful content, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, furthering bias or discrimination,\ncybersecurity attacks including spear phishing attacks, data privacy violations, other activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline, or to\ndevelop competing technologies  While we may mitigate certain risks associated with the improper use of our AI models through both technical measures and\nthe inclusion of contractual restrictions on third-party use in any agreement between us and any third party, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be\neffective \nIt is not possible to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI and changes in laws, rules, directives, and regulations or other regulatory developments\nregarding the use of AI, including restrictions around the collection and use of data, may adversely affect our ability to develop and use AI or subject us to legal\nliability  In addition, we\nhave made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers,\nand developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products  For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower\nrate than our Feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future \nWe may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results  In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to\nfocus on helping to bring the metaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build next-generation\ninterfaces \nHowever, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain \nWe regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our\nproduct ideas and designs evolve  In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to\na variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition,\ncontent regulation, tariffs, export controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services,\nincrease our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business  As a result of these or other factors, our\nReality Labs strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or\nfinancial results \nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired,\nand our business and financial results may be harmed  We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is\ncritical to maintaining and expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers  Maintaining and\nenhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do\nsuccessfully  We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our\nactions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users,\nand other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and\n22 Table of Contents\nmay in the future adversely affect, our reputation and brands  For example, in January 2025, we announced certain changes to our content policies and\nenforcement efforts to further free expression on our platform and mitigate over-enforcement of certain of our content policies  In addition, in March 2018, we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a\ndeveloper that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies  We also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the\nsharing of content on our services, or to practices by advertisers or developers, that are illegal, illicit, or in violation of our policies, or fail to otherwise enforce\nour policies, address objectionable content or practices on our services, or address other user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode\nconfidence in our brands \nOur brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users\nacting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to\nmanipulate opinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related purposes or to censor certain\ncontent on our platform, by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around geopolitical\nevents or elections in the United States and around the world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent\nOversight Board, by research or media reports concerning the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, by our decisions\nregarding whether to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service, or by any\nnegative sentiment associated with our management \nMaintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful  Certain of our\nactions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and\nother content, as well as user well-being issues, have eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future  If we fail to successfully\npromote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial results may be adversely affected \nWe may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our products \nSuch existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building, growing, or monetizing applications that create and maintain user engagement  We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience,\nand we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers  For example, from time to time, we have taken actions\nto reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on our products with the objective of enhancing the user experience, and such actions\nhave reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization opportunities from, applications integrated with our products  In addition, as part\nof our efforts related to privacy, safety, and security, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and we also have\nannounced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data  If we are not successful in our efforts to\nmaintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with our products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain\ngood relations with such developers, our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected \nWe compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies\nthat sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns  We face\nsignificant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate,\nand discover content\n23 Table of Contents\nand information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences  We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our\nproducts, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling\napplications that integrate with our products  We also expect to face additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as\nother companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to innovate through the development and application of AI and other new\ntechnologies, as well as efforts to develop the metaverse \nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments,\ngeographic regions, or user demographics than we do  These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than\nus to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions \nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching\nand successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies  Some competitors may gain a competitive\nadvantage against us in areas where we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads;\nby imposing fees or other charges related to our applications or our delivery of ads; by making access to our products more difficult or impossible; by making it\nmore difficult to communicate with our users; by limiting the ability of our devices or products to interoperate with their popular platforms or products; or by\nintegrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems, search engines, browsers, or e-\ncommerce platforms \nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors' products;\n\u2022 the size and composition of our user base;\n\u2022 the engagement of users with our products and competing products;\n\u2022 our ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;\n\u2022 the timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors' products;\n\u2022 our safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their data;\n\u2022 our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;\n\u2022 our ability to monetize our products;\n\u2022 the frequency, size,

including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on\ntheir investments;\n\u2022 our ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building applications that integrate with our products;\n\u2022 our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with our products;\n\u2022 changes mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;\n\u2022 acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\n\u2022 our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly specialized technical personnel including software engineers, designers,\nand product managers;\n\u2022 our ability to cost-effectively manage our operations; and\n\u2022 our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors \nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our user base, level of user engagement, and ability to deliver ad impressions may decrease, we may become\nless attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected  You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets \nOur financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control,\nincluding:\n\u2022 our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement, particularly for our products that deliver ad impressions;\n\u2022 our ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;\n\u2022 our ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers or advertising agencies or resellers in a particular period;\n\u2022 fluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year, episodic\nregional or global events, or other factors;\n\u2022 the frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;\n\u2022 the enforcement of our advertising policies, including the removal of ads and marketers from our platform;\n\u2022 the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;\n\u2022 changes to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising,\nincluding changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\n\u2022 the pricing of our ads and other products;\n\u2022 the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;\n\u2022 our ability to

costs related to our data centers and technical infrastructure as well as other costs relating to our AI\ninitiatives;\n\u2022 costs related to our privacy, safety, security, and content and

or actions by\ngovernments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;\n\u2022 the overall tax rate for our business, which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the U  and in jurisdictions with different tax rates, the\neffects of share-based compensation, the effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, the effects of changes in our business or\nstructure, and the effects of discrete items such as legal and tax settlements and tax elections;\n\u2022 the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the period such laws are enacted or\ninterpretations are issued, and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period;\n\u2022 tax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations, including the examination we are currently under by the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS), that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated;\n\u2022 fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;\n\u2022 trading activity in our share repurchase program;\n26 Table of Contents\n\u2022 fluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities, in the valuation of our non-marketable equity securities, and in\ninterest rates;\n\u2022 the incurrence of indebtedness or our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on acceptable terms;\n\u2022 changes in U  Any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and\nmarketer demand for advertising on our products, which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have\nexperienced such adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time  Such events also expose our business, operations, and workforce to a variety of other risks, including: volatility in the size of our user base\nand user engagement; delays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer hardware, as a result of\ninventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages; significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future; illnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce,\nwhich may result in inefficiencies, delays, and disruptions in our business; and increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the\nbasis for estimates used in our financial statements  Any of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or\nregulatory actions against us \nWe incur significant expenses in operating our business, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base, as\nusers increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for example with respect to video, as we develop and implement\nnew products, as we market new and existing products and promote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest\nin new and unproven technologies, including AI and machine learning, and as we continue our efforts to focus on privacy, safety, security, and content and\nadvertising review and enforcement  We have previously undertaken cost reduction measures in light of a more challenging operating environment, which may\nadversely affect these or other business initiatives, and some of these measures have involved, and may in the future involve, up-front charges and outlays of\ncash to reduce certain longer-\n27 Table of Contents\nterm expenses \nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption in our products and services\ncould damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results \nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and services and our\nunderlying technical infrastructure  We have experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products and\nservices from time to time  If our products or services are unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they\ndo not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our products or services as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted, any\nof which could adversely affect our business and financial performance  In addition, as\nthe amount and types of information shared on our products continue to grow and evolve, as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve,\nand as our internal operational demands continue to grow, especially with the deployment of AI technologies, we will need an increasing amount of technical\ninfrastructure, including network capacity, computing power, and related energy requirements, to continue to satisfy our needs  Although we are making\nsignificant investments in our technical infrastructure, it is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to\naccommodate these increased demands or achieve our business objectives, which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue  In\naddition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power\nloss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events and crises  Global climate change could result in\ncertain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects  We also have been, and may in the future be, subject to increased energy and/or other costs to maintain the\navailability or performance of our products and services in connection with any such events  Any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers\ncould harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business  We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, various challenges with the supply chain related to supporting our technical infrastructure \nAny of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products or services, require unfavorable changes to\nexisting products or services, delay the introduction of future products or services, or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results \nWe have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products, and we plan to\ncontinue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects  We have\n28 Table of Contents\nchanged, suspended, and terminated certain of these projects as a result of various factors, and may continue to do so in the future  Additional unanticipated\ndelays or disruptions in the completion of these projects, including due to the availability of components, power or network capacity, or any shortage of labor\nnecessary in building portions of such projects, challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals, or other geopolitical challenges or actions\nby governments, whether as a result of trade disputes or otherwise, may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery\nor degradation of the quality or reliability of our products and services, or impairment of assets on our balance sheet  For example, like others in our industry,\nwe rely on certain third-party equipment and components for our technical infrastructure that are manufactured by a small number of third parties, often with\nsignificant operations in a single region such as Asia \nFurther, much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the United States, and action by a foreign government, or our response to such government\naction, has resulted, and may result in the future, in the impairment of a portion of our technical infrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the\nquality or reliability of our products and lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs  These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are\nsubject to statistical variances and uncertainties \nTo calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples\nof user accounts and calibrated against user survey data  We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which survey questions are\nbased on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error  In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain\ndetails of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates  From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make\nproduct changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular\nperiod \nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business \nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our\nads  We have been, and may in the future be, subject to\nlitigation as well as marketer, regulatory, and other inquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates  Where marketers, developers, or investors\ndo not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discover material\n30 Table of Contents\ninaccuracies in our metrics or estimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may be harmed, and marketers and developers may be less willing to\nallocate their budgets or resources to our products that deliver ad impressions, which could negatively affect our business and financial results  The scale of our business and breadth of\nour products create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users,\nmarketers, developers, and other third parties, and maintaining information technology systems and internal controls and procedures that support the scale and\ncomplexity of our business  To effectively manage our scale, we must maintain, and continue to adapt, our operational, financial, and management processes\nand systems, manage our headcount and facilities, and effectively train and manage our personnel  As our organization continues to evolve, and we are\nrequired to implement and adapt complex organizational management structures, we may find it difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture,\nincluding our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products  We currently make our Family products available in a total of more than 100 different languages, and we\nhave offices or data centers in approximately 40 different countries  We may enter new international regions where we have limited or no experience in\nmarketing, selling, and deploying our products  Our products are generally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be\navailable in certain regions due to legal and regulatory complexities  For example, several of our products are not generally available in China  We also\noutsource certain operational functions to third parties globally  If we fail to deploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business\nmay suffer  companies with sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions,\nincluding with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade compliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectual\nproperty, environmental, health and safety, accessibility, licensing, and infrastructure matters;\n\u2022 potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or requirements to provide user\ninformation to local authorities;\n\u2022 enhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards, terms of service, and other policies across\ndifferent languages and countries;\n\u2022 fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\n\u2022 foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the\nUnited States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently;\n\u2022 higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\n\u2022 enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\n\u2022 burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal,\n31 Table of Contents\ncontent moderation, data localization, data protection, competition, e-commerce and payments, and regulatory oversight;\n\u2022 reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022 difficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated\nwith multiple international locations, including difficulties arising from personnel working remotely;\n\u2022 compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\n\u2022 geopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes, armed conflicts, and pandemics  Government agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal\npenalties they may seek to impose against companies for violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations, import and export controls, trade restrictions,\nsanctions, and other laws, rules, and regulations  We also may be required to or elect to cease or modify our operations or the offering of our products and services in certain regions, including as a\nresult of the risks described above, which could adversely affect our business, user growth and engagement, and financial results \nWe face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks with respect to our consumer hardware products that, if not properly managed, could adversely\nimpact our financial results \nWe face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware products  Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures to meet our customers'\nexpectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective  We have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages, strikes or other disruptions in logistics and the\nsupply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product development, and sales  We could be negatively affected if\nwe are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations\n(whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of\nsuch arrangements with them  The manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by\nmacroeconomic conditions, geopolitical challenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments or non-state actors (including international conflicts,\ntariffs, sanctions, export controls, and other measures that restrict international trade) that subject us to supply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain or\nlogistics disruptions \nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and certain company policies regarding\nsourcing practices and standards on labor, trade compliance, health and safety, the environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or their\npractices and standards and have experienced violations of these requirements from time to time  If any supplier or business partner violates laws, fails to\nimplement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could\nexperience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to our reputation \nWe are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, unsafe or\ndefective merchandise, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our\nconsumer hardware products, higher tariffs that increase consumer prices, and other factors  The acquisition of certain\ntypes of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable \nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits, many of which claim statutory\ndamages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future \nBecause of the scale of our user, advertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages\neven if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent  In addition, we have faced, currently face, and will continue to face additional class action\nand other lawsuits based on claims related to advertising, antitrust, privacy, security, biometrics, content, algorithms, copyright, user well-being, employment,\ncontingent workers, activities on our platform, consumer protection, or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and\nsoftware, including virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven  For example, we are currently the subject of multiple putative class\naction suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well\nas other alleged anticompetitive conduct; a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; the\ndisclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021; and allegations that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size for advertisements,\nresulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices  We are also the subject of multiple lawsuits related to our alleged use of biometric technology, our\nalleged recommendation of and/or failure to remove harmful content, information from third-party websites or apps via our business tools, our alleged use of\ncopyright-protected content to train our AI models, and allegations that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in users and allegations of\nviolations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)  The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any\nnegative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable changes to our products or business\npractices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected \nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a\nsignificant burden on management and employees \nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial condition or results of operations and\nmay adversely affect the price of our common stock \nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary\ncompanies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other strategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures  For example, we completed our divestiture of Giphy in 2023 following the United Kingdom Competition and\nMarkets Authority's order directing us to divest Giphy post-acquisition  In addition, although we were able to successfully complete the acquisition after\nprevailing in federal court, the FTC sought to enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited  We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we\nregularly grant restricted stock units to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results,\nand result in dilution to our stockholders  In addition, any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users,\nmarketers, developers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock \nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance,\nwhich may result in significant unanticipated costs  In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or\nother strategic transaction, including tax and accounting charges  If we fail to successfully integrate the\ncompanies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed  The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation\nand certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Meta  Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken,\nincluding our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could\nincrease our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flows  Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are litigating this issue, the ultimate\nresolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may adversely affect our financial results \nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are\nmany transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain  Our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our\nbusiness, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate  Although we believe that our provision for\nincome taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial\nstatements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made  As additional\njurisdictions enact legislation, transitional relief expires, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation become effective, our effective tax rate and cash\ntax payments could increase in future years  For example, several jurisdictions have\nproposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to\nour business \nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides\npreferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state\naid in certain cases  For example, in 2024, excess tax benefits recognized from\nshare-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $3 \n35 Table of Contents\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings \nWe review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as a\ndecline in stock price and market capitalization  We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually  If such goodwill or intangible\nassets are deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be\nrecognized  We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or\nintangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations \nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business  Zuckerberg and certain other\nmembers of management participate in various high-risk activities, such as combat sports, extreme sports, and recreational aviation, which carry the risk of\nserious injury and death  Zuckerberg were to become unavailable for any reason, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations  The loss of\nother key personnel, including members of management as well as key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could also disrupt\nour operations and have an adverse effect on our business \nIn addition, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position  As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our equity\nawards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our\nexisting employees, we would incur substantial additional share-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further\ndiluted  Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility  In addition, restrictive immigration\npolicies or legal or regulatory developments relating to immigration may negatively affect our efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our\nexisting personnel  If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be\nunable to grow effectively \nMark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding\ncapital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors\nand any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  Zuckerberg owes a\nfiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders  The specific timing and amount of any share\nrepurchases, and the specific timing and amount of any\n36 Table of Contents\ndividend payments, will depend on prevailing share prices, general economic and market conditions, company performance, and other considerations \nThe payment of any cash dividends in the future is subject to continued capital availability, market conditions, applicable laws and agreements, and our\nboard of directors continuing to determine that the declaration of dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders \nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\nActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, censor or moderate content on our products in their\ncountries, or otherwise impair our ability to sell or deliver advertising in their countries, could substantially harm our business and financial results \nGovernments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on Facebook or our other products in their country, restrict access to our\nproducts from their country partially or entirely, or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended\nperiod of time or indefinitely  For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in\nChina, Iran, and North Korea  In addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in\nviolation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from\ntime to time  For example, in 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and\nblock access to content, and suspend user services, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted  In addition, if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other\noperations in Hong Kong as a result of the National Security Law or other legislation, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected  In\naddition, in connection with the war in Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were\nthen prohibited by the Russian government, which has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our revenue and business in the region \nIt is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell or deliver advertising, including in countries where access\nto our consumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted  For example, we generate meaningful revenue from a small number of resellers serving\nadvertisers based in China, and it is possible that the Chinese, United States, or other government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based\nadvertising revenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, including any tariffs implemented by the United States or China, in\nresponse to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as imposing taxes or\nother penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results \nSimilarly, if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for companies in Turkey, the Turkish government could take action to\nreduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products  In the event that content shown on Facebook or\nour other products is subject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make\nchanges to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or\ncapture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base,\nuser engagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and\nour financial results could be adversely affected  Many of these laws and regulations are subject to\nchange and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our products and business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of\noperations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business \nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data\nuse, data combination, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity,\ncontent, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data\ndisclosure, AI and machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights,\naccessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political\nlaw compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services  The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions,\nor other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny  As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws\nand regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\ninconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices  For example, regulatory or legislative actions or\nlitigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in\nvarious ways, including for advertising, have in the past and could in the future adversely affect user growth and engagement, affect the manner in which we\nprovide our services, or adversely affect our financial results, including by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global\nrevenue \nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain\ndata that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services  Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final\nDecision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland\u2019s reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was\nnot in compliance with the GDPR  The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the\nEuropean Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the \u201cData Privacy Framework List,\u201d maintained and made publicly available by the\nUnited States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U  DPF by the CJEU could create\nconsiderable uncertainty and lead to us being unable to offer a\n38 Table of Contents\nnumber of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations \nIn addition, we have been managing investigations and lawsuits in India and other jurisdictions regarding the 2021 updates to WhatsApp's terms of\nservice and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other Meta products and services, including a lawsuit currently pending before the Supreme\nCourt of India and an order by the Competition Commission of India, which we are appealing  As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of\npenalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our\noperations  The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California\nPrivacy Rights Act (CCPA), also establishes certain transparency rules and creates certain data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of\ncertain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties  These laws and regulations are evolving\nand subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely\naffected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business  Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject to\ninterpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting\nour advertising business  For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising\non Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023\nwe began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative  In addition, the European Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer\nprotection organizations have raised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws  These or any similar\ndevelopments in the future may negatively impact our user growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results  The DMA also includes\nsignificant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements are enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies as of March 2024  Further, the DSA, which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, imposes certain restrictions and\nrequirements for our products and services, subjects us to increased compliance costs, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance  The interpretation\nand enforcement of the DMA and the DSA, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty  In\naddition, some countries, such as the UK, India, and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements, new\ncompetition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could require substantial changes to our products,\nincrease the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, and/or result in fines\nor other penalties  New legislation or regulatory decisions may restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors or also limit our advertising\nservices or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions  While enforcement of a number of these statutes (or parts of them) has been enjoined as a result of legal challenges to\nthem, it is possible that the decisions to enjoin these statutes may be overturned, the injunctive orders may expire, and certain statutes are coming into effect\nthat may not be subject to injunctions  Should enforcement of one or more of these statutes not be enjoined, we may not be able to comply with certain of these\nstatutes by their respective effective dates  We may face similar challenges in light of recent legislation in Australia which imposes a social media ban for users\nunder 16 years old that is expected to be effective by December 2025, requiring certain social media companies to take reasonable steps to ensure under 16 year\nolds do not create user accounts  There has been\nincreased focus on these initiatives by many regulators, investors, and other stakeholders and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable\nfederal, state, local or international laws and regulations could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations \nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any government actions, have led to, and may in the future\nlead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, changes to our products, loss of revenue, delays or impediments in the development of\nnew products, negative publicity and reputational harm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our\nbusiness, including fines, damages, or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices \nWe have been and remain subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and we expect to continue to be\nsubject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices\nin a manner materially adverse to our business  We are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for\ninformation, actions, and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use, data combination, and data\nprotection, including with respect to processing of sensitive data, data from third parties, data for advertising purposes, data security, minors, data subject\nrights, safety, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content and content moderation, use of our platform for illegal, illicit, or otherwise\nobjectionable activity, competition, AI, and machine learning  In addition, beginning in March\n2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection\nwith our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms\nand policies  The state attorneys general inquiries and\nlitigation, and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing  The FTC also continues to monitor us and our compliance with the modified\nconsent order and initiated an administrative proceeding against us, which we are challenging at the agency and in federal court, that alleges deficient\ncompliance and violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and\nseeks changes to our business  We also notify\nthe IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, and other regulators of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, issue\nsimilar notifications to European regulators under other laws (such as UK GDPR and Member State implementations of the ePrivacy Directive), and are\nsubject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance  In addition, we are subject to\ninquiries and investigations by the European Commission regarding our compliance with various provisions of the DSA relating to the use of Facebook and\nInstagram, including matters related to elections, content reporting and appeals, third-party access to data, political content recommendations, potential\ndeceptive advertising and disinformation, and minors and other vulnerable users  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust\nlaws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp  In addition, in November 2024, the European Commission\nissued a fine as a result of its finding that we tied Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition\nrules  state privacy laws, youth social media laws, the ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, and other\nregulatory and legislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices, and any compliance\nfailures may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results  state privacy laws, youth social media laws, the ePrivacy Directive, DMA, DSA, EU AI Act, the Korean Personal\nInformation Protection Act, and the Indian Digital Personal Data Protection Act  In particular, we are maintaining a comprehensive privacy program in\nconnection with the FTC consent order that includes substantial management and board of directors oversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting\nobligations, prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the\nFTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party assessor, which has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to\nmaintain and enhance  In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements\nare constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation \nThe FTC initiated an administrative proceeding against us alleging, among other things, deficient compliance with the FTC consent order and seeking\nsubstantial modifications to the requirements of the consent order, including a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to\nthe composition of our board of directors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products  If the challenge is unsuccessful and the FTC is able to impose the proposed order in its current form, it would limit our ability to\nprovide certain features and services, engage in certain business practices, require us to further increase the time, resources, and costs we spend on compliance\nand oversight efforts, and would adversely affect our business and financial results \nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims\nrelated to our products, and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely\naffect our business and financial results \nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims and government and regulatory inquiries relating to information or content that is\npublished or made available on our products, including claims, inquiries, and investigations relating to our policies, algorithms, and enforcement decisions with\nrespect to such information or content  In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation, dissemination of misinformation or\nnews hoaxes, deceptive and fraudulent advertising, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of publicity and privacy, personal injury torts,\nlaws regulating hate speech or other types of content, on- or offline safety and well-being (such as acts of violence, terrorism, improper promotion or\ndistribution of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs, human exploitation, child exploitation, illegal gaming, and other fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity),\nproducts liability, consumer protection, and breach of contract, among others  For example, over the last several years we have seen an increase in claims\nbrought by younger users related to well-being issues based on allegedly harmful content that is shared on or recommended by our products \nThe potential risks relating to any of the foregoing types of claims are currently enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our\nprotection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less\n42 Table of Contents\nprotected under local laws than we are in the United States  For example, in April 2019, the European Union passed a directive (the European Copyright\nDirective) expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which the EU member states have\nsince implemented into their national laws  Supreme\nCourt heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency\nAct (Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision  There also have been, and continue to be, various other\nlitigation concerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the protections under Section 230, as well as to\nimpose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings, user access and content, including electoral-related and AI-generated content,\ncounterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or\nchange  We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages  For example, legislation in Germany and India has resulted, and may result in the future, in the imposition of fines or\nother penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations  Numerous other countries in\nEurope, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing liability or potentially significant\npenalties, including fines, service throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes  Content-related legislation also has required us, and may require us in the future, to change our products\nor business practices, increase our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies  For example, the\nEuropean Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the\navailability of that content, which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes  Certain countries have also implemented or proposed legislation that may\nrequire us to pay publishers for certain news content shared on our products  For example, as a result of such legislation in Canada, we have ended the\navailability of news content for Canadian users on Facebook and Instagram  In the United States, changes to the protections available under Section 230 or the\nFirst Amendment to the U  Constitution or new state or federal content-related legislation or investigations may increase our costs or require significant\nchanges to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect user growth and engagement \nSeveral of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase tangible, virtual, and digital goods from merchants and\ndevelopers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send money to other users, and make donations to certain charitable organizations, among\nother activities  We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-money\nlaundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtual\ncurrency, consumer protection, charitable fundraising, economic sanctions, and import and export restrictions  The Rule, which is under legal challenge by a trade association, could subject\ncertain of our payments products to this authority  We\nhave received certain\n43 Table of Contents\npayments licenses in the United States, the European Economic Area, and other jurisdictions for our regulated Payments-related products and activities  These\nlicenses increase flexibility in how our use of Payments may evolve, help mitigate regulatory uncertainty, and will generally require us to demonstrate\ncompliance with many domestic and foreign laws in relation to our regulated Payments products and activities \nWe have also launched payments functionality on certain of our applications and may in the future undertake additional payments initiatives, including as part\nof our metaverse efforts, which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements  Any failure to prevent or\nmitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information from\nusers, or information from marketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or other misuse of such data, which could harm our\nbusiness and reputation and diminish our competitive position  Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide,\ndegrade the user experience or otherwise adversely affect users, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal\nsystems, or result in financial harm to us  In addition, other parties may attempt to fraudulently\nor maliciously induce employees, contractors, vendors, or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users' data  However, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or\nadhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or\ndisclosed \nWe regularly experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees, and we incur significant costs in protecting against or\nremediating such incidents  As a result, government authorities, affected users, or other parties could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in\nconnection with any actual or perceived security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of data, or other cybersecurity issues, which has occurred in the\npast and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices  We\nmay also be subject to increased risk as a result of changes to our content policies and enforcement efforts which we began to implement in January 2025 to\nfurther free expression on our platform and mitigate over-enforcement of certain of our content policies \nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in these systems, or\nfailures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could adversely affect our business \nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or maintained internally and/or by third\nparties (including open source software and the operating systems and browsers which users rely on to run our applications and access our systems), that is\nhighly technical and complex  The software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the future contain, errors, bugs, or\nvulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives  Errors, bugs,\nvulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within\n45 Table of Contents\nthe software and hardware on which we rely, or human error or malfeasance in using such systems, have led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes\nincluding a negative experience or other adverse effects for users and marketers who use our products, compromised ability of our products to perform in a\nmanner consistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, delayed product introductions or enhancements, targeting, measurement, or billing errors,\ncompromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property or other data, or reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our\nservices  For example, we make commitments to our users as to how their data will be collected, used, shared, and retained within and across our products, and\nour systems are subject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably  In addition, any errors, bugs,\nvulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our\nsystems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users, have led to, and may in the future lead to,\noutcomes including damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or\nother remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results \nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and\nthird parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our\nproprietary rights  In the United States and internationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property, and\nwe currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications\nfrom third parties  In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every\ncountry in which we operate or intend to operate our business  In addition, we regularly contribute software\nsource code under open source and other permissive licenses and have made other technology we developed available under such licenses, and we include open\nsource software in our products  Additionally, our AI is trained on data sets that may include open source software and the outputs of our AI may be subject to\nopen source license restrictions or obligations  As a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be\nrequired to license or disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk \nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent, trademark, and copyright lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are\nexpensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations  Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed,\nor introduce new features for existing products, which could increase our exposure to intellectual property claims from competitors, non-practicing entities, and\nother rights holders \nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent, copyright, and trademark holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services,\ntrademarks, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights  We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face\nincreasing competition and develop new products and services, we expect the number of intellectual property claims against us to grow  Defending intellectual\nproperty litigation is often costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final\noutcomes will be obtained in all cases  In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any\nsuch litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us\n46 Table of Contents\nto change or cease some or all of our operations  In addition, we may\nhave to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may\nsignificantly increase our operating costs and expenses  In\naddition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past fluctuated and may in the\nfuture fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable segments;\n\u2022 the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022 actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our\ncompany, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022 additional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with acquisitions, or the anticipation of\nsuch sales;\n\u2022 investor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint\nventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022 announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base, the level of user engagement, or\nthe effectiveness of our ad products;\n\u2022 changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including our developers and\ncompetitors;\n\u2022 price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022 the inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\n\u2022 media coverage of our business and financial performance;\n\u2022 lawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\n\u2022 adverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition, content, privacy, or other matters,\nincluding interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\n\u2022 trading activity in our share repurchase program; and\n47 Table of Contents\n\u2022 other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other disruptive external events, or responses to\nthese events \nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of\nequity securities of many technology companies  We are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the\nmisuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the\nsecond quarter of 2018; a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; and the disclosure of our\nearnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 \nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B\ncommon stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters  Holders of our Class B common stock,\nincluding our founder, Chairman, and CEO, together hold a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore are able to\ncontrol the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9 \nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions,\nsuch as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes  The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the\neffect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term  Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control\na majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock \nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing\nthe trading price of our Class A common stock \nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a\nchange in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes\nan interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders  In addition, our current certificate of incorporation and\nbylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n\u2022 until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the combined voting power of our\ncommon stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding\nClass B common stock voting as a separate class;\n\u2022 we currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr  Zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters\nrequiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common\nstock;\n48 Table of Contents\n\u2022 when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, certain\namendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding\nshares of Class A and Class B common stock;\n\u2022 when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock,\nvacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\n\u2022 when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, our\nboard of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed\nfrom office for cause;\n\u2022 when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, our\nstockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u2022 only our board chair, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of\nstockholders;\n\u2022 advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of\nstockholders;\n\u2022 our certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be\nissued, without stockholder approval; and\n\u2022 certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware  We maintain an information security program that is comprised of policies and controls designed\nto mitigate cybersecurity risk  We also engage third-party security experts and\nconsultants to assist with assessment and enhancement of our cybersecurity risk management processes, as well as benchmarking against industry practices  In addition, we maintain a privacy risk management\nprogram to assess privacy risks related to how we are collecting, using, sharing, and storing user data, which is subject to assessment by an independent, third-\nparty privacy assessor  Our risk mitigation strategies\ninclude a broad variety of technical and operational measures, as well as annual cybersecurity and privacy training for all of our employees \nIn addition, we maintain specific policies and practices governing our third-party security risks, including our third-party assessment (TPA) process \nUnder our TPA process, we gather information from certain third parties who contract with Meta and share or receive data, or have access to or integrate with\nour systems, in order to help us assess potential risks associated with their security controls  We also generally require third parties to, among other things,\nmaintain security controls to protect our confidential information and data, and notify us of material data breaches that may impact our data  Management is responsible for identifying, assessing, and managing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes\nto ensure that such potential cybersecurity risk exposures are monitored, putting in place appropriate mitigation measures, maintaining cybersecurity policies\nand procedures, and providing regular reports to our board of directors, including through the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and Privacy & Product\nCompliance Committee \nIn 2024, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy,\nresults of operations, or financial condition  As of December 31, 2024, we owned and leased approximately 11 million square feet\nof office and building space for our corporate headquarters and in the surrounding areas, which included approximately two million square feet of unoccupied\noffice and building space that we plan to either sublease, early terminate, or abandon related to our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts  We also owned\nand leased approximately 62 acres of land to be developed to accommodate anticipated future growth  Legal Proceedings\nAs a multinational company with a complex and evolving business, we are, and expect to continue to be, subject to numerous claims, litigation,\nregulatory, tax, and government inquiries and investigations, and other legal proceedings in jurisdictions around the world  For example, we are facing numerous cases in the United States in which plaintiffs are attempting to avoid\nor limit the application of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to their claims and certain of those matters have survived motions to dismiss,\nincluding through the use of products liability theories  Outside of the United States, we are subject to new regulatory regimes, including the Digital Services\nAct, Digital Markets Act, EU AI Act and similar statutes in non-EU countries such as the UK Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act, and new fining\nguidelines under existing regulatory regimes like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  We are facing inquiries and investigations regarding various\naspects of our regulatory compliance, as well as private litigation in Europe, including class and mass actions, claiming damages (including for loss of control\nof data without other damage) and/or injunctions in respect of alleged failings to comply with such regulatory requirements \nIn some instances, particularly with novel legal and factual claims, new regulatory regimes or statutes that have not previously been enforced, or where\nthe nature or type of enforcement pursued against us is novel, it can be very difficult to assess the likelihood or extent of potential liabilities, including the\nnature and extent of injunctive or other non-monetary relief and the applicability and amount of any potential forfeitures, disgorgement, fines or penalties \nWhile we have identified below certain matters that we believe to be material, there can be no assurance that additional material losses or limitations on our\nactivities will not result from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be material \nPrivacy and Related Matters\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and\ncertain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain\ndata by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief  In\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U  The state attorneys general inquiries and

issue similar notifications to European regulators under\n52 Table of Contents\nother laws (such as UK GDPR and Member State implementations of the ePrivacy Directive), and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and\nother European regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance  In addition, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that\nMeta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was\nnot in compliance with the GDPR  The

included in the \"Data Privacy Framework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the United States Department of Commerce\npursuant to the EU-U \nBeginning on June 7, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we improperly received individuals' information from\nthird-party websites or apps via our business tools in violation of our terms and various state and federal laws and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive\nrelief (for example, In re Meta Pixel Healthcare Litigation; In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases; Frasco v  These cases are in different stages, but several of our motions to dismiss have been denied in whole or in part, while certain others\nhave been granted in whole or in part  On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint (FTC v )\nagainst us in the U  District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in\nviolation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in\n2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform  The FTC sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust\nlaws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp  On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motion to dismiss\nthe complaint filed by the FTC with leave to amend  On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to\ndismiss this amended complaint  On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint  Multiple putative\nclass actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and\nother causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief  Several of\nthe cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in the U  On March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers  On December\n6, 2022, the court denied our\n53 Table of

the Functioning of the European Union in relation to certain alleged business practices relating to Facebook Marketplace and imposed a fine of\napproximately EUR \u20ac798 million \nIn March 2024, the European Commission opened an investigation into the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" consent model with\nrequirements under Article 5(2) of the Digital Markets Act \nSecurities and Other Actions\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and\nelsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in\nconnection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of

with prejudice  On October 14, 2024, plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal  Putative class actions have been filed in the United States, Brazil, and Canada on behalf of users in those jurisdictions, and numerous school\ndistricts, municipalities, and tribal nations have filed public nuisance claims in the United States, Brazil, and/or Canada based on similar allegations  These additional lawsuits include allegations regarding violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), child\nsexual abuse material and other child safety concerns, as well as violations of state consumer protection laws, unfair business practices, public nuisance, and\nproducts liability, with proceedings focused on our alleged business practices (including the use of end-to-end encryption) and harms to users under 18 years\nold \nBeginning in November 2024, counsel for thousands of individual claimants began sending mass arbitration demands relating to \"social media addiction\" and\nrelated harms allegedly caused by Instagram  On May 16, 2024, the European\nCommission opened formal proceedings assessing our compliance with certain requirements under Articles 28, 34, and 35 of the Digital

functioning of Instagram and Facebook \nOther Actions\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size\nfor advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices  In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court\ndismissed certain of the plaintiffs' claims, but permitted their fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed  On March 29, 2022, the court granted the\nplaintiffs' motion for class certification \nBeginning on July 7, 2023, multiple putative

First\nAmendment questions, and sending the case back down to the lower courts where the case continues \n55 Table of Contents\nOn April 30, 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings against us to assess Facebook and Instagram's compliance with certain\nrequirements under Articles 14, 16, 17, 20, 24, 25, 34, 35, and 40 of the DSA, regarding a range of topics including elections, content reporting and appeals,\nthird-party access to data, political content recommendations, potential deceptive advertising and disinformation, including the way in which we identified,\nassessed, and mitigated against certain systemic risks on Instagram and Facebook \nOn September 18, 2024, staff of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) initiated a Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise\n(NORA) process related to its investigation of advertising for financial products and services on our platform, informing us that staff may recommend to the\nDirector of the CFPB that the Bureau take legal action alleging violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, including based on our alleged receipt and\nuse for advertising of financial information from third parties through certain advertising tools as well as our related user disclosures and controls, and provided\nus with an opportunity to respond  We disagree with the claims staff is considering and believe an enforcement action is unwarranted, and have responded\nthrough the NORA process  The result of the NORA process is uncertain at this time, but if the Director authorizes an action against us, the CFPB could file a\nlawsuit in the near-term and seek financial penalties and equitable relief \nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil,\nRussia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including\nour obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances  A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties\nagainst us  We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously\ndefend such fines and penalties \nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary\ncourse of business, and we expect to be subject to additional legal proceedings and disputes in the future  Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information for Common Stock\nOur Class A common stock is trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol 'META' \nOur Class B common stock is not listed on any stock exchange nor traded on any public market 51 per share as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market  RSUs granted on or after March 1, 2024 under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which was most recently amended in\nMay 2024, are entitled to dividend equivalent rights \nSubject to legally available funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend on\nour outstanding common stock  The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account\nvarious factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash, and current and anticipated cash needs  The annual changes for the five-year period shown in the graph assumes that $100 was invested in our common stock and each index at the market close\non the last trading day for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and that all dividends were reinvested  In addition to our historical\nconsolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs  We believe these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial\nresults between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics\nused by management in operating our business  The increase in costs and expenses was mainly due to increases in operational expenses related to\nour data centers and technical infrastructure and employee compensation, partially offset by lower restructuring and legal-related costs \n\u2022 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $77 \nDividend\nBeginning in February 2024, we declared and paid four quarterly cash dividends, including dividend equivalents, totaling $2  Total dividends and dividend equivalents paid were $4 \nFamily of Apps Metrics\n\u2022 Family daily active people (DAP) was 3  Our advertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending\nas a result of limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating\nsystems and browsers \nIn particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, including its evolving interpretation through\ndecisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, ePrivacy Directive, European Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, and U  state privacy laws\nincluding the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad\nproducts, and an increasing\n60 Table of Contents\nnumber of laws have been introduced limiting or prohibiting the provision of our services to younger users \nFor example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced our plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and\nInstagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and began offering users in the region a\n\"subscription for no ads\" alternative  In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or\nannounced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising  For\nexample, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and\nother iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of\nthe budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms  In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data\ninto our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps  More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools\nto help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad\nproducts  Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI, to improve our delivery,\ntargeting, and measurement capabilities \nIn addition, we maintain advertising policies to protect the security and integrity of our platform and comply with global content, security, and integrity\nobligations  Our ongoing efforts to enhance enforcement against ads and marketers which violate our advertising policies adversely affect our revenue, and we\nexpect that the continued enhancement of such efforts will have an impact on our revenue in the future, which may be material \nOther Business and Macroeconomic Conditions\nOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our\nuser growth and engagement and advertising revenue  In particular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured from time to time by factors such as\ninflation, high interest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending  While we saw improvement in business and\nmacroeconomic conditions in recent periods, continued business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty remains, which could impact our financial\nresults in future periods  We are investing in Reels and in AI\ninitiatives across our products, including our AI-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant content, which we have already seen results in improved\nuser engagement and monetization of our products  However, we continue to face competition from other products and services within certain demographics,\nin particular younger users  We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more\nregions from time to time due to geopolitical conditions, which have adversely affected our user growth and engagement \nInvestment Philosophy\nWe expect to continue to build on the discipline and habits that we developed in 2022 when we initiated several efforts to increase our operating\nefficiency, while still remaining focused on investing in significant opportunities  These efforts include significant investments in AI initiatives, including to recommend relevant content across\nour products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products using generative AI  In particular, we expect\nour AI initiatives will require increased investment in infrastructure and headcount  Our revenue in regions such as\nUnited States & Canada and Europe is relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets, and ad\nimpression growth is primarily in geographies that monetize at lower rates, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World \nTrends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the\nvalue of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures  Substantially all of our daily active people (as defined below) access our\nFamily products on mobile devices \n\u2022 Daily Active People (DAP)  We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp\n(collectively, our \"Family\" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or\nmobile browser on a given day  As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based\non internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our\nestimates \n \n \nNote: Our ad impressions growth by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when an ad impression\nis delivered \n \n \nNote: Our average price per ad growth by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when an ad\nimpression is delivered \nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business \nCertain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages  The\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any\nfailure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action \nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and\nrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed  We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our\ndefenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information  Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updated\ninformation available  For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations\nregarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted\nagainst us  In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy regulator, the Irish Data\nProtection Commission, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of\nan inquiry \nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable or if and when the reasonably\npossible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain  Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts that materially differ\nfrom management's estimates of losses, it could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our results of operations and financial condition, including in a\nparticular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable  Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for\nincome taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws  Our\nactual and forecasted income (loss) before\n68 Table of Contents\nprovision is subject to change due to economic, political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to recognize our\nnet deferred tax assets \nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position  These uncertain tax positions include our estimates related to uncertainties\nwith our research and development tax credits that are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities\nsupporting the tax credits will be sufficient  Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance\nthat the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different, as significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for\nincome taxes  To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such\ndifferences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial\ncondition and operating results \nValuation of Assets\nThe valuation and impairment assessment of certain assets, including recoverability, requires significant judgment and assumptions such as estimation of\nfuture cash flows, discount rates, market data of comparable assets and companies, holding period and residual value of asset groups, among others \nImpairment testing for long-lived-assets, including property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, occurs whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable compared to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected\nto generate from the use and eventual disposition  The impairment test is performed at the asset group level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\nindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities  When the test results indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the\ncarrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value \nImpairment testing for non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative is\nperformed at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment  When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair\nvalue of our non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in our consolidated\nstatements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  In addition, for these non-marketable equity securities, determining whether a\nnon-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the non-marketable equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of\ndifferences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b)\nadjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most\nadvantageous markets  Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur\nin a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred \nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, which resulted in an increase in their estimated\nuseful life to 5  Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising\nagencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users  We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the\naction the marketer contracted for  We calculate average price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the average price\npaid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action \nReality Labs (RL)\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and related software and\ncontent  These mainly include expenses\nrelated to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings,\nemployee compensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth\ncosts \nMarketing and sales  Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of employee compensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and\nbenefits for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions; marketing and promotional\nexpenses; and professional services to support our community and product operations  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation which includes payroll, share-based\ncompensation and benefits for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other\nadministrative employees; legal-related costs, which include estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as\nother legal fees; other taxes, such as digital services taxes and other non-income-based tax levies; and professional services \nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 2023

was mainly from a 13% growth in employee headcount from 2023 to 2024 in engineering and other technical\nfunctions supporting our continued investment in our family of products and Reality Labs

(19)%\nPercentage of revenue 7 % 9 % 13 %\nMarketing and sales expenses in 2024 decreased $954 million, or 8%, compared to 2023  The increase in costs and expenses was mainly due to increases in\noperational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, mostly from higher depreciation expense and employee compensation, partially\noffset by lower restructuring and legal-related costs \nProvision for income taxes\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 2023 2022 2024 vs 2023 %change 2023 vs 2022 %change\n(in millions, except percentages)\nProvision for income taxes $ 8,303 $ 8,330 $ 5,619 \u2014 % 48 %\nEffective tax rate 12 % 18 % 19 %\nOur provision for income taxes in 2024 decreased $27 million compared to 2023, due to a decrease in the effective tax rate, offset by an increase inincome before provision for income taxes  Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision\nfor income taxes: U  If our stock price\nremains constant to the January 24, 2025 price, and absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2025 to be in the\nrange of 12-15%  As additional\njurisdictions enact legislation, transitional relief expires, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation become effective, our effective tax rate and cash\ntax payments could increase in future years  As of December 31, 2024, we had net uncertain tax positions of $9  These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties with our research tax credits and transfer\npricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which include licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations  Cash, cash equivalents, and\nmarketable securities are comprised of cash on deposit with banks, time deposits, money market funds, U  government and agency securities, investment\ngrade corporate debt securities, and marketable equity securities  As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial\ninstitutions and our investment holdings are in diversified highly rated securities  Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $77 77 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock unit (RSU)\nawards 36 billion net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as\n$16  The increase in cash flows from operating\nactivities during 2024 compared to 2023, was due to an increase in cash collection from our customers driven by the increase in revenue, partially offset by\nhigher cash paid for income taxes and other operational spending 75 billion of net purchases of marketable securities  The increase in cash used in investing activities\nduring 2024 compared to 2023 was mostly due to increases in net purchases of marketable debt securities and property and equipment \nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $60 billion to $65 billion in 2025 to support our core business and generative AI efforts 77 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs, partially offset by $10 76 billion increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs  GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as a non-GAAP measure to manage\nour business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate resources \nWe believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and provides useful information regarding\nhow cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our business  FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses \nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 91,328 $ 71,113 $ 50,475 \nPurchases of property and equipment (37,256) (27,045) (31,186)\nPrincipal payments on finance leases (1,969) (1,058) (850)\nFree cash flow $ 52,103 $ 43,010 $ 18,439 \n77 Table of Contents\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet our operational cash\nneeds and fund our investments in infrastructure and AI initiatives, share repurchases and dividend payments for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for\nthe foreseeable future  Our finance lease obligations include certain network infrastructure 28 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases \nDividend\nWe paid four quarterly cash dividends, including dividend equivalents, totaling $2  Total dividends and dividend equivalents paid were $5  Subject to legally\navailable funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend and dividend equivalents on\nour outstanding common stock \nTaxes\nCash paid for income taxes was $10 99 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024  Due to uncertainties in the timing of\nthe completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing\nof payments \nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations  Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which\nare beyond our control \n78 Table of Contents\nSee Note 8 \u2014 Leases, Note 10 \u2014 Long-term Debt, Note 12 \u2014

risk \nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring\nmonetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded \nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest income and market value of our cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, and\nthe fair value of our long-term debt \nOur cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities consist of cash, time deposits, money market funds, U  Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and\nsupporting our liquidity requirements  interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities, and\nthe market value of those securities  A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $680 million and\n$355 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively  Any realized\ngains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes and from the current unrealized gains or losses would only occur if we sold the investments prior to\nmaturity  However, the fair value of the Notes will fluctuate with movements in market interest rates, increasing in periods of\ndeclining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates \nEquity Price Risk\nOur equity investments include marketable and non-marketable equity securities subject to equity price risks that could have a material impact on the\nfair value or carrying value of our holdings  Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks and our non-marketable equity securities are\ninvestments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values \n79 Table of Contents\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market values, of which\npublicly traded stocks are subject to market price volatility and represent $1  A hypothetical adverse\nprice change of 10% on our December 31, 2024 balance would decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by $123 million  We did not hold any\nmarketable equity securities as of December 31, 2023 \nWe elected to account for substantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment,\nadjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar securities of the same issuer  We perform a qualitative\nassessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment  Valuations of our non-marketable equity securities are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and\nobservable transactions  Uncertainties in the global economic climate and financial markets could adversely impact the valuation of the companies we invest in\nand, therefore, result in a material impairment or downward adjustment in our investments  Our total non-marketable equity securities, which mostly consists\nof our investment in Jio Platforms Limited, had a carrying value of $6

and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations \u2014 Critical Accounting\nEstimates\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud \n82 Table of Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nDescription of the Matter As described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and\nregulatory or government inquiries and investigations  However, for certain other matters, the Company discloses that the amount of such\nlosses or a range of possible losses cannot be reasonably estimated at this time \nHow We Addressed theMatter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and\nevaluation of these matters, including controls relating to the Company's assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realized\nand their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of possible losses \nOur audit procedures included reading the minutes or a summary of the meetings of the committees of the board of directors,\nreading the proceedings, claims, and regulatory or government inquiries and investigations, or summaries as we deemed\nappropriate, requesting and receiving internal and external legal counsel confirmation letters, meeting with internal and external\nlegal counsel to discuss the nature of the various matters, and obtaining representations from management \n83 Table of Contents\nUncertain Tax Positions\nDescription of the Matter As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has received certain notices from the Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS) related to transfer pricing agreements with the Company's foreign subsidiaries for certain periods\nexamined  If the IRS prevails in\nits position, it could result in an additional federal tax liability, plus interest and any penalties asserted  The Company uses\njudgment to (1) determine whether a tax position's technical merits are more-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure the\namount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition \nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these uncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to the\nsignificant judgment required to assess management's evaluation of technical merits and the measurement of the tax position\nbased on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings \nHow We Addressed theMatter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process\nto assess the technical merits of tax positions related to these transfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit of those tax\npositions  This included assessing the Company's\ncorrespondence with the relevant tax authorities, evaluating income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained by the\nCompany, and requesting and receiving confirmation letters from third-party advisors  (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024,\nbased on the COSO criteria \nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances  A company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements \nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except number of shares and par value)\nDecember 31,\n 2024 2023\nAssets   \nCurrent assets:   \nCash and cash equivalents $

Reclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts on the consolidated balance sheets have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation  GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not\nlimited to, those related to loss contingencies, income taxes, valuation of long-lived assets and their associated estimated useful lives, valuation of non-\nmarketable equity securities, revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities and accounts receivable, and\nfair value of financial instruments and leases \nIn January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, and determined we should extend the estimated\nuseful lives to 5  These costs are\nrecorded within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income  Marketers pay for\nad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of\nactions, such as clicks, taken by our users  We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the\naction the marketer contracted for  In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the\ncustomer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price \nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and certain customers may receive cash-\nbased incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize \nReality Labs Revenue\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and related software and\ncontent  These mainly include expenses related to the\noperation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, employee\ncompensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs  For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is\naccepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met \nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to external\nusers, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products  RSUs granted to employees are measured based on\nthe grant-date fair value  Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on the\nstraight-line basis over the requisite service period and forfeitures are accounted for as they occur  Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for\nincome taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws \nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method  We consider\nall available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable\nincome and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance \nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position  We recognize interest and

securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair\nvalue are assessed to determine what amount of that difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses  Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities\nare recognized as a charge in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income, and any remaining unrealized losses, net of\ntaxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity  We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable\nsecurities on a specific identification method and include such gains or losses in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of\nincome \nWe also hold investments in marketable equity securities that are publicly traded stocks  We classify these equity securities as marketable securities\nwithin current assets on our consolidated balance sheets because they are available to be converted into cash to fund current operations without any restriction \nThese marketable equity securities are measured at fair value at each reporting date with the resulted unrealized gains and losses recognized in interest and\nother income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income \nWe classify certain restricted cash balances, consisting mostly of cash related to insurance policies, cash reserves designated for a specific purpose, as\nwell as retention and indemnification holdback for our acquisitions, within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our consolidated\nbalance sheets, based upon the expected duration of the restrictions \nNon-marketable Equity Securities\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values  We elected to account for\nsubstantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair\nvalue resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer as of the respective transaction dates  We periodically\nreview our non-marketable equity securities for impairment  When indicators exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below its carrying amount,\nwe write down the investment to fair value  For additional information, see Note 6 \u2014 Non-marketable Equity Securities \nIn addition, we also held other non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the equity method which were not material as of December 31,\n2024 and 2023 \nFair Value Measurements\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value\nin the financial statements on a recurring basis  We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are\nrequired to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk\nmeasurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\nrestrictions and credit risk  Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels\nand bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities \n95 Table of Contents\nLevel 2- Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or\nliabilities \nLevel 3- Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing\nthe asset or liability \nOur cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash equivalents are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because\ntheir fair values are derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs  Certain other assets are\nclassified within Level 3 because factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity \nOur non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis  When\nindicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions occur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified\nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and\nother unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold  Depreciation is computed using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter \nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use (ROU) assets as of December 31, 2024 are\ndescribed below:\nProperty and Equipment Useful Life/ Amortization period\nServers and network assets Four to Five years \nBuildings 25 to 30 years\nEquipment and other One to 25 years\nFinance lease right-of-use assets Five to 20 years\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\n_______________________\n(1) Effective January 2025, the useful lives of certain servers and network assets are extended to 5 \nWe evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable  If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable,\nand the asset's fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized \nThe useful lives of our property and equipment are management's estimates when the assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the\nremaining estimated useful lives  Our estimate of useful lives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may\ndiffer from the actual useful lives due to changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements  When we\nchange the estimated\n(1)\n96 Table of Contents\nuseful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised\nestimated useful life  We also capitalize interest on our debt related to certain eligible CIP assets and depreciate over the useful life of the\nrelated assets \nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred  When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated\ndepreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations \nLease Obligations\nOur operating leases mostly comprise of certain data centers, offices, and colocations  We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure  We\ndetermine if an arrangement is a lease at inception and most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components  Non-lease components include fixed\npayments for maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees  Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate\ntaxes, or other costs  These amounts are affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on energy production for renewable energy purchase\narrangements, and maintenance and utilities  For certain\ncolocation and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities \nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at the\ncommencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time\nof commencement \nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options  When determining\nthe probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based, asset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors  Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual\nvalue guarantees or material restrictive covenants \nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement\ndate in determining the present value of lease payments \nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms  Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the\nshorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded net impairment losses of $383 million, $2  The fair values of the impaired assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models (income approach) based on market participant\nassumptions with Level 3 inputs  The assumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases,\nprojected sublease income over the remaining lease periods, and discount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows \n97 Table of Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business \nCertain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages  The\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any\nfailure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action \nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their\nestimated fair values as of the acquisition date  The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and\nliabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination  For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach  Goodwill is\ntested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit below its carrying value  We have two reporting units, Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL), subject to goodwill impairment\ntesting  As of December 31, 2024, no impairment of goodwill has been identified \nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of such assets may not be recoverable  If such review indicates that the carrying amount of a\nfinite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable and the asset's fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized  The impairment\ncharges of finite-lived intangible assets were not material during the reporting periods presented \nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and\naccounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life  We routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives\nof finite-lived intangible assets  If we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over the\nrevised estimated useful life  Translation gains and\nlosses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive\n98 Table of Contents\nincome (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity \nForeign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved\nare recorded within interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income \nCredit Risk and Concentration\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash,\nmarketable debt securities, and accounts receivable  Cash equivalents consists mostly of money market funds, that primarily invest in U  Marketable debt securities consist of investments in U  As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions and our marketable debt\nsecurities are held in diversified highly rated securities  We generated\n36%, 37%, and 40% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the United\nStates, with a majority of the revenue outside of the United States in 2024 coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Brazil, Australia, India\nand Canada  We maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses,\nand bad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years

requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate\nreconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction  It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax\ndisclosures  The new guidance requires disaggregated information about certain income\nstatement expense line items on an annual and interim basis  These measures included a\nfacilities consolidation strategy to sublease, early terminate, or abandon several office buildings under operating leases, a layoff of approximately 11,000\nemployees across the Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL) segments, and a pivot towards a next generation data center design, including cancellation\nof multiple data center projects

and Canada on behalf of users in those jurisdictions, and numerous school\ndistricts, municipalities, and tribal nations have filed public nuisance claims in the United States, Brazil, and/or Canada based on similar allegations  These additional lawsuits include allegations regarding violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), child\nsexual abuse material and other child safety concerns, as well as violations of state consumer protection laws, unfair business practices, public nuisance, and\nproducts liability, with proceedings focused on our alleged business practices (including the use of end-to-end encryption) and harms to users under 18 years\nold \nBeginning in November 2024, counsel for thousands of individual claimants began sending mass arbitration demands relating to \u201csocial media addiction\u201d and\nrelated harms allegedly caused by Instagram  On May 16, 2024, the European\nCommission opened formal proceedings assessing our compliance with certain requirements under Articles 28, 34, and 35 of the Digital Services Act (DSA),\nincluding the way in which we identified, assessed, and mitigated against certain systemic risks to minors and other vulnerable users that may stem from the\ndesign and functioning of Instagram and Facebook \nOther Actions\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us

topics including elections, content reporting and appeals,\nthird-party access to data, political content recommendations, potential deceptive advertising and disinformation, including the way in which we identified,\nassessed, and mitigated against certain systemic risks on Instagram and Facebook \nOn September 18, 2024, staff of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) initiated a Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise\n(NORA) process related to its investigation of advertising for financial products and services on our platform, informing us that staff may recommend to the\nDirector of the CFPB that the Bureau take legal action alleging violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, including based on our alleged receipt and\nuse for advertising of financial information from third parties through certain advertising tools as well as our related user disclosures and controls, and provided\nus with an opportunity to respond  We disagree with the claims staff is considering and believe an enforcement action is unwarranted, and have responded\nthrough the NORA process  The result of the NORA process is uncertain at this time, but if the Director authorizes an action against us, the CFPB could file a\nlawsuit in the near-term and seek financial penalties and equitable relief \nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil,\nRussia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal

assessment of fines and penalties\nagainst us  We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously\ndefend such fines and penalties \nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain\nmatters  We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property\ninfringement or other claims made by third parties  These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of\nthe claim  In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation\nand bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations \nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification\nclaims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 93 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program 28 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases \nThe timing and actual number of

primarily accrued for the uncertainties with our research tax credits and transfer pricing with our foreign\nsubsidiaries, which include licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions  During all years presented, we recognized interest and\npenalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on our consolidated statements of income 11 billion within our provision of income taxes at such time  Our 2014 through 2016 tax years are with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals for certain unresolved issues  Our 2020 and subsequent tax years\nremain open to examination by the IRS  We are under examination by the Irish Revenue Commissioners for our 2020 tax year and our 2021 and subsequent tax\nyears remain open to examination  On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer was filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an\nadjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice  This value will need to be extrapolated into income adjustments to determine the specific tax liability, which will likely remain in dispute and will\nnot be resolved until the Tax Court enters a decision  If the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an\nestimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9  The IRS applied its\nposition from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and\ncertain tax credits that we claimed  If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to\napproximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U  In addition, if the IRS prevails\nin its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax\nthat we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax\nitems that may ultimately result from these examinations  The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is\nreasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months  Given the number of years remaining\nthat are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits  If the tax\nauthorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial\nposition, results of operations, and cash flows  These costs and expenses include certain product development related\noperating expenses, costs associated with partnership arrangements, consumer hardware product costs, content costs, and legal-related costs \nIndirect operating expenses, such as facilities, information technology, certain shared research and development activities, recruiting, and physical security\nexpenses are mostly allocated based on headcount (2) Includes costs and expenses in FoA segment for infrastructure, professional services, partner arrangements,\u2009marketing, facilities, legal-related costs, and other expenses \n(3) Includes costs and expenses in RL

responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under\nthe Exchange Act) \nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any\ncontrols and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives  In\naddition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints\nand that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs  Other Information\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the officers and directors listed below

Index, we surveyed pr ivate and public sector \nleaders worldwide to measure progress on their AI journeys  \nTh\nese sharp drops suggest that AI innovation is outpacing organizations\u2019 capacity to deploy \nAI effectively at scale  There's a vision gap at the top, as leaders struggle to set audacious AI \ngoals while also driving measurable results  But many lack the proper guardrails needed to \ninnovate safely at scale  \nWe identified an e lite cohort of Pacesetter companies that are leading the pack across all \ndimensions of AI maturity  \nIn this report, we provide a view from halfway up the AI summit  We show how AI Pacesetters \nare leveraging AI by connecting data, automation, and workflows  Then we offer a roadmap \nfor how any organization can deploy AI, govern it, and measure ROI in ways that benefit \ncustomers, employees, and the bottom l ine  \nOur key takeaways: Ag entic AI is enabling enterprises to d eploy autonomous software \nagents that collaborate with other agents in pu rsui t of defined goals  The right leadership \nstrategy and platform are essential to success  And in the age of AI, human talent and \ncreativity are more important than ever  4

responses, we assigned each \norganization an overall AI maturity score between \n0 and 100  \nWhen we fielded the first AI Maturity Index study in \nearly 2024, organizations were just coming to grips with \nthe potential of generative AI to deliver better, faster \nexperiences for customers and employees  One year \nlater, emerging tools such as agentic AI are taking \ntransformation to the next level  \nEmerging AI technologies are already delivering \nmeasurable value, and organizations are enthusiastic \nabout embracing AI across the enterprise  On the other \nhand, the rapid pace of innovation is leading to a decline \nin AI maturity  \nTo track the state of AI maturity across the globe, Oxford \nEconomics and ServiceNow surveyed just under 4,500 \nexecutives worldwide and measured organizational \nperformance across five pillars of AI maturity: \n\u2022 AI strategy and leadership\n\u2022 Workflow integration\n\u2022 Talent and workforce\n\u2022 AI governance\n\u2022 Realizing value in AI investment\nGlass half full \nImportantly, our research findings don\u2019t spell doom for the \nenterprise  While overall AI maturity levels have dropped, \nAI is generating meaningful returns for nearly every \norganization we studied  More than two-thirds of them \n(67%) say AI has increased their organization\u2019s gross \nmargin  \nRegardless of use case, AI provides ROI for most \norganizations, with nearly half reporting \u201csignificant\u201d ROI \nfor search functions, analytical AI, process AI, and \npredictive tools  Executives expect their organization\u2019s \ninvestment in AI to increase by about 8  \nAnd while our Pacesetters are not immune to the maturity \nslowdown, they are still well ahead of the pack when it \ncomes to deploying AI productively at scale  Their \napproach to AI holds valuable lessons for all \norganizations  \nTHE AI -DRIVEN FUTURE \nenterprise AI maturity \ndropped 9 points Y/Y, \nfrom 44 to 35 \n9pts \n82% \nexpect to increase \nAI investment \nnext year \n \u00a9 2025 ServiceNow, Inc  6 \nTo realize the full power of AI, think of it as a spectrum from \nincremental outcomes through exponential results  Along \nthis spectrum are three levels of AI  \n\u2022 Analytical AI predicts a numerical outcome or\nrecommends a particular action based on specific,\nsingle-focused tasks, such as a chatbot \n\u2022 Generative AI generates content in response to natural\nlanguage prompts, such as generating case resolutions,\nemails to prospects, or code \n\u2022 Agentic AI creates an orchestration layer across an\nenterprise that acts autonomously and proactively\nmakes decisions to execute material business activities\nthrough end-to-end workflows \nIncremental forms of AI are an important advance in \ntechnology  But to reap the exponential rewards AI can offer, \ncompanies must adopt all three levels of AI and embed \nthem within a platform that can take action in pursuit of \ndefined goals  \nEarly days for agentic AI \nENTERPRISE AI MATURITY INDEX 2025 THE AI -DRIVEN FUTURE \nAgentic AI\u2014a type of artificial intelligence that acts autonomously in pursuit of \ndefined goals\u2014has emerged as the next big thing in tech  \nHowever, only about one third of respondents have reached at least the piloting \nstage for any agentic AI use case  Those who have started to implement agentic AI \nare already seeing gains  \nAbout 40% of executives are considering adding agentic AI tools to their tech stack \nwithin the next 12 months, but most feel they lack the proper governance guardrails \nto do so successfully  \nChris Bedi \nChief Customer \nOfficer and \nEnterprise AI \nAdvisor, \nServiceNow \n28% 55% \nAgentic AI uptake is low at this point\u2026 \nare somewhat

\nGood help is hard to find \nHuman talent is critical for transforming AI from a novel \ngadget into a mission-critical tool  Key challenge: It's not always clear what skills \npeople need to work effectively with AI  \nMeasurement struggles persist \nAI is changing faster than executives can develop \nstrategies to harness it  Few leaders have a concrete \nidea of how to implement AI in their organization by \nconnecting business strategy to technology strategy  \nInnovation requires governance \nMany enterprises are driving AI adoption by encouraging \ntheir employees to experiment with AI  This creates \npotential risks, given most enterprises surveyed also say \nthey don\u2019t yet have the right guardrails in place to govern \nAI effectively  \nstrongly agree they have the mix

different dimensions of the AI Index contribute to the \ncorrelation between profitability and index scores  \nThe Forbes Global 2000 list includes the world's biggest companies measured \nby sales, profits, assets, and market value  \nBy isolating the correlation between each dimension and the financial gains \nfrom AI maturity, we found the following three dimensions to be the greatest \ncontributors to the potential $113 billion boost in profitability: \nThe two dimensions most strongly correlated with profitability are leadership \nand governance, driving home the importance of

outcomes progress \nSignificant progress made or strongly agree \nPacesetters use AI to explore possibilities that humans \ncouldn't achieve without AI, and outcomes that AI \ncouldn\u2019t achieve without humans  Unlike digitization, \nwhich mostly solves yesterday\u2019s problems, this AI-first \nmindset reimagines capabilities, outcomes, business \nmodels, products, services, and experiences  AI-first \norganizations see everything differently, from the \nproblems they identify to the outcomes they seek  \nFor our Pacesetter cohort, AI is also a decision-making \nflywheel  Nearly 60% of them use AI to generate \nleadership insights, compared to just 23% of others  \nBecoming an AI-first business means redesigning \nworkflows so that intelligence flows seamlessly and \nenhances every operation  It means piloting next-\ngeneration AI solutions and exploring new possibilities \nto create value  It means envisioning future opportunities \nto augment human intelligence within the enterprise, \nand adopting an intelligent, connected platform that \nconnects data, people, and processes  \nBy embracing an AI-first mindset, Pacesetters break \nfree from linear progress and achieve new levels of \nperformance, output, and effectiveness  \nTakeaways \nDevelop an AI vision and prepare for the future \nTake a strategic approach to AI implementation that \nemphasizes a strong vision anchored in clear metrics  \nPartner with AI stakeholders to build an \ninnovation center \nInnovation centers enable Pacesetters to quickly and \nsecurely experiment with new technologies  \nEmploy AI applications that span multiple \nbusiness areas \nCompared to others, Pacesetters are more likely to \nprioritize AI investments that supercharge more than \none function, driving revenue while

content, it is not capable of empathy or \ncreativity  Humanizing AI transformation is crucial  \nAs you fine-tune your AI strategies and spearhead cultural adoption, consider three things  Do not think of AI as a replacement for human \nconnection  Leverage AI as a tool that can \nhelp humans build things that spark emotion, inspire trust, and foster relationships  \nUse AI as a catalyst for human potential  AI can take human creativity, efficiency, and \ndecision-making to the next level  Leaders who see AI as a force multiplier for creativity will \ndrive more value than those who aim to replace employees with machines  Invest in your \nemployees through reskilling and upskilling so they can work alongside AI rather than be \ndisplaced by it  \nTake an AI-first mindset  Move away from a legacy mindset of merely iterating on \nyesterday\u2019s technologies to an AI-first one, which allows for true business transformation \npowered by innovative AI  To get the most out of AI, it helps to have a single system \nthat manages cross-functional workflows and optimizes for a world that is not constrained \nby human boundaries  \nENTERPRISE AI MATURITY INDEX 2025 PACESETTERS LEAD

MATURITY INDEX 2025 PACESETTERS LEAD THE WAY \nProgress leveraging AI to improve \nwork processes \nA platform approach that leverages a single codebase \nmakes it easy to manage the entire enterprise  Sixty-six \npercent of Pacesetters employ a platform approach with \nbuilt-in AI capabilities across the enterprise, compared to \n46% of others  \nThis approach makes it easier for Pacesetters to employ \nnew AI tools such as agentic AI at scale, because they \ndon\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel every time a new \ntechnology or application hits the market  \nThey harness AI-powered digital workflows to connect \npeople, data, and processes across the enterprise  By taking this approach, Pacesetters can translate \nAI insights into concrete business outcomes  \nTakeaways \nBust silos \nAI can't transform your organization if it's confined in \ndiscrete functions  \nDream bigger \nWith the advent of AI, many organizations are focused \non identifying individual tasks that can be automated  \nWhile automating routine tasks is important, Pacesetters \nare more focused on building a holistic strategy for AI \nimplementation  This approach might take longer to \nimplement but can lead to greater gains down the road  \nPartner with AI \nA quarter of Pacesetters have focused on \nhuman/machine collaboration, leading to sharp \nefficiency gains  \nAI is used to investigate

Index is based on responses to our global survey, which we \nanalyzed using statistical and econometric modeling techniques  The Index serves as \na tool for organizations to better understand their performance in relation to others \nin their market or industry  Given these objectives, ServiceNow and Oxford Economics \ndefined five dimensions of AI maturity: strategy and leadership, workflow integration, \ntalent and workforce, AI governance, and realizing value in AI investment  \nUsing PCA to create an index has two main benefits: \n\u2022 Simplification: PCA helps condense large amounts of information \nfrom different questions into a smaller number of key components  \nThis helps generate an index without losing important details  \n\u2022 Objective representation: PCA ensures that the index reflects \nthe most important patterns in the data, without being influenced \nby any specific set of factors  This means the index gives a fair \nand accurate picture of responses, making it more reliable for \ndecision-making  \nThe PCA scores are standardized on a scale ranging from zero to 100\u2014with zero \nrepresenting no enterprise AI maturity and 100 representing full enterprise AI \nmaturity\u2014to enable comparisons  The standardized scores for the five dimensions \nare then combined and equally weighted to generate a single Enterprise AI Maturity \nIndex rating  The choice of equal weights reflects the researchers\u2019 view that all five \ndimensions are equally important in defining the AI maturity of an organization  29

    "content": "Artificial Intelligence\nIndex Report 2025 Artificial Intelligence\nIndex Report 2025\n1\nWelcome to the eighth edition of the AI Index report  The 2025 Index is our most comprehensive to date and arrives at an \nimportant moment, as AI\u2019s influence across society, the economy, and global governance continues to intensify  New in \nthis year\u2019s report are in-depth analyses of the evolving landscape of AI hardware, novel estimates of inference costs, and \nnew analyses of AI publication and patenting trends  We also introduce fresh data on corporate adoption of responsible AI \npractices, along with expanded coverage of AI\u2019s growing role in science and medicine  \nSince its founding in 2017 as an offshoot of the One Hundred Year Study of Artificial Intelligence, the AI Index has been \ncommitted to equipping policymakers, journalists, executives, researchers, and the public with accurate, rigorously validated, \nand globally sourced data  Our mission has always been to help these stakeholders make better-informed decisions about the \ndevelopment and deployment of AI  In a world where AI is discussed everywhere\u2014from boardrooms to kitchen tables\u2014this \nmission has never been more essential  \nThe AI Index continues to lead in tracking and interpreting the most critical trends shaping the field\u2014from the shifting \ngeopolitical landscape and the rapid evolution of underlying technologies, to AI\u2019s expanding role in business, policymaking, \nand public life  Longitudinal tracking remains at the heart of our mission  In a domain advancing at breakneck speed, the Index \nprovides essential context\u2014helping us understand where AI stands today, how it got here, and where it may be headed next \nRecognized globally as one of the most authoritative resources on artificial intelligence, the AI Index has been cited in major \nmedia outlets such as The New York Times, Bloomberg, and The Guardian; referenced in hundreds of academic papers; \nand used by policymakers and government agencies around the world  We have briefed companies like Accenture, IBM, \nWells Fargo, and Fidelity on the state of AI, and we continue to serve as an independent source of insights for the global AI \necosystem \nIntroduction to the  \nAI Index Report 2025 Artificial Intelligence\nIndex Report 2025\n2\nAs AI continues to reshape our lives, the corporate world, and public discourse, the AI Index continues to track its progress\u2014\noffering an independent, data-driven perspective on AI\u2019s development, adoption, and impact, across time and geography   \nWhat a year 2024 has been for AI  The recognition of AI\u2019s role in advancing humanity\u2019s knowledge is reflected in Nobel prizes in \nphysics and chemistry, and the Turing award for foundational work in reinforcement learning  Meanwhile, AI adoption has \naccelerated at an unprecedented rate, as millions of people are now using AI on a regular basis both for their professional work \nand leisure activities  As high-performing, low-cost, and openly available models proliferate, AI\u2019s accessibility and impact are set \nto expand even further \nAfter a brief slowdown, corporate investment in AI rebounded  The number of newly funded generative AI startups nearly \ntripled, and after years of sluggish uptake, business adoption accelerated significantly in 2024  AI has moved from the margins \nto become a central driver of business value  Policymakers are no longer just debating AI\u2014they\u2019re investing in it  Several \ncountries launched billion-dollar national AI infrastructure initiatives, including major efforts to expand energy capacity to \nsupport AI development \nYet trust remains a major challenge  Fewer people believe AI companies will safeguard their data, and concerns about fairness \nand bias persist  In response, \ngovernments are advancing new regulatory frameworks aimed at promoting transparency, accountability, and fairness  While skepticism remains, a global survey in 2024 showed a notable rise in optimism about AI\u2019s \npotential to deliver broad societal benefits \nAI is no longer just a story of what\u2019s possible\u2014it\u2019s a story of what\u2019s happening now and how we are collectively shaping the \nfuture of humanity  Explore this year\u2019s AI Index report and see for yourself \nYolanda Gil and Raymond Perrault\nCo-directors, AI Index Report\nMessage From the Co-directors Artificial Intelligence\nIndex Report 2025\n3\nTop Takeaways\n1  AI performance on demanding benchmarks continues to improve    In 2023, researchers introduced new \nbenchmarks\u2014MMMU, GPQA, and SWE-bench\u2014to test the limits of advanced AI systems  Beyond \nbenchmarks, AI systems made major strides in generating high-quality video, and in some settings, language model agents even \noutperformed humans in programming tasks with limited time budgets  AI is increasingly embedded in everyday life   From healthcare to transportation, AI is rapidly moving from the lab \nto daily life  In 2023, the FDA approved 223 AI-enabled medical devices, up from just six in 2015  operators, provides over 150,000 autonomous rides each week, while \nBaidu\u2019s affordable Apollo Go robotaxi fleet now serves numerous cities across China  Business is all in on AI, fueling record investment and usage, as research continues to show strong \nproductivity impacts  private AI investment grew to $109  Generative AI saw particularly strong momentum, attracting $33  AI business usage is also accelerating: 78% of organizations reported using AI in \n2024, up from 55% the year before  Meanwhile, a growing body of research confirms that AI boosts productivity and, in most \ncases, helps narrow skill gaps across the workforce  still leads in producing top AI models\u2014but China is closing the performance gap -\nbased institutions produced 40 notable AI models, compared to China\u2019s 15 and Europe\u2019s three  maintains its lead \nin quantity, Chinese models have rapidly closed the quality gap: performance differences on major benchmarks such as MMLU \nand HumanEval shrank from double digits in 2023 to near parity in 2024  China continues to lead in AI publications and patents  The responsible AI ecosystem evolves\u2014unevenly   AI-related incidents are rising sharply, yet standardized RAI \nevaluations remain rare among major industrial model developers  However, new benchmarks like HELM Safety, AIR-Bench, \nand FACTS offer promising tools for assessing factuality and safety  Among companies, a gap persists between recognizing RAI \nrisks and taking meaningful action  In contrast, governments are showing increased urgency: In 2024, global cooperation on AI \ngovernance intensified, with organizations including the OECD, EU, U , and African Union releasing frameworks focused on \ntransparency, trustworthiness, and other core responsible AI principles  Global AI optimism is rising\u2014but deep regional divides remain  In countries like China (83%), Indonesia (80%), \nand Thailand (77%), strong majorities see AI products and services as more beneficial than harmful  In contrast, optimism remains \nfar lower in places like Canada (40%), the United States (39%), and the Netherlands (36%)  Still, sentiment is shifting: Since 2022, \noptimism has grown significantly in several previously skeptical countries, including Germany (+10%), France (+10%), Canada \n(+8%), Great Britain (+8%), and the United States (+4%)  AI becomes more efficient, affordable, and accessible  Together, these trends are rapidly lowering the barriers to advanced AI  Governments are stepping up on AI\u2014with regulation and investment  federal agencies introduced \n59 AI-related regulations\u2014more than double the number in 2023\u2014and issued by twice as many agencies  Globally, legislative \nmentions of AI rose 21  AI and computer science education is expanding\u2014but gaps in access and readiness persist  Two-thirds \nof countries now offer or plan to offer K\u201312 CS education\u2014twice as many as in 2019\u2014with Africa and Latin America making \nthe most progress  Yet access remains limited in many African countries due to basic infrastructure gaps like electricity , 81% of \nK\u201312 CS teachers say AI should be part of foundational CS education, but less than half feel equipped to teach it  Industry is racing ahead in AI\u2014but the frontier is tightening  Nearly 90% of notable AI models in 2024 came \nfrom industry, up from 60% in 2023, while academia remains the top source of highly cited research  Model scale continues to \ngrow rapidly\u2014training compute doubles every five months, datasets every eight, and power use annually  AI earns top honors for its impact on science   AI\u2019s growing importance is reflected in major scientific awards: \nTwo Nobel Prizes recognized work that led to deep learning (physics) and to its application to protein folding (chemistry), \nwhile the Turing Award honored groundbreaking contributions to reinforcement learning  Complex reasoning remains a challenge   AI models excel at tasks like International Mathematical Olympiad \nproblems but still struggle with complex reasoning benchmarks like PlanBench  They often fail to reliably solve logic tasks even \nwhen provably correct solutions exist, limiting their effectiveness in high-stakes settings where precision is critical  Artificial Intelligence\nIndex Report 2025\n6\nChair Members\nRaymond Perrault\nSRI International\nChair-elect\nYolanda Gil\nUniversity of Southern \nCalifornia, Information

highly cited research   Industry\u2019s lead in notable model development, highlighted in the two \nprevious AI Index reports, has only grown more pronounced, with nearly 90% of notable models in 2024 (compared to 60% \nin 2023) originating from industry  Academia has remained the single leading institutional producer of highly cited (top 100) \npublications over the past three years  China leads in AI research publication totals, while the United States leads in highly influential research  \nIn 2023, China produced more AI publications (23  institutions have contributed the most top-100-cited AI publications  AI publication totals continue to grow and increasingly dominate computer science   Between 2013 and \n2023, the total number of AI publications in venues related to computer science and other scientific disciplines nearly tripled, \nincreasing from approximately 102,000 to over 242,000  Proportionally, AI\u2019s share of computer science publications has risen \nfrom 21  The United States continues to be the leading source of notable AI models -based institutions \nproduced 40 notable AI models, significantly surpassing China\u2019s 15 and Europe\u2019s combined total of three  AI models get increasingly bigger, more computationally demanding, and more energy intensive  \nNew research finds that the training compute for notable AI models doubles approximately every five months, dataset sizes \nfor training LLMs every eight months, and the power required for training annually  Large-scale industry investment continues \nto drive model scaling and performance gains  AI models become increasingly cheaper to use  The cost of querying an AI model that scores the equivalent of \nGPT-3  AI patenting is on the rise  Between 2010 and 2023, the number of AI patents has grown steadily and significantly, \nballooning from 3,833 to 122,511  In just the last year, the number of AI patents has risen 29  As of 2023, China leads in total \nAI patents, accounting for 69 7% of all grants, while South Korea and Luxembourg stand out as top AI patent producers on a \nper capita basis  AI hardware gets faster, cheaper, and more energy efficient  Carbon emissions from AI training are steadily increasing  Training early AI models, such as AlexNet (2012), had \nmodest amounts of carbon emissions at 0  More recent models have significantly higher emissions for training: GPT-3 \n(2020) at 588 tons, GPT-4 (2023) at 5,184 tons, and Llama 3  AI masters new benchmarks faster than ever   In 2023, AI researchers introduced several challenging new \nbenchmarks, including MMMU, GPQA, and SWE-bench, aimed at testing the limits of increasingly capable AI systems  By 2024, \nAI performance on these benchmarks saw remarkable improvements, with gains of 18  On SWE-bench, AI systems could solve just 4  Last year\u2019s AI Index revealed that leading open-weight models lagged significantly \nbehind their closed-weight counterparts  AI model performance converges at the frontier  According to last year\u2019s AI Index, the Elo score difference \nbetween the top and 10th-ranked model on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard was 11  The AI landscape is \nbecoming increasingly competitive, with high-quality models now available from a growing number of developers   In 2024, OpenAI \nintroduced models like o1 and o3 that are designed to iteratively reason through their outputs  The saturation of traditional AI benchmarks like \nMMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval, coupled with improved performance on newer, more challenging benchmarks such as MMMU \nand GPQA, has pushed researchers to explore additional evaluation methods for leading AI systems 80%; FrontierMath, a complex mathematics \nbenchmark where AI systems solve only 2% of problems; and BigCodeBench, a coding benchmark where AI systems achieve a \n35  High-quality AI video generators demonstrate significant improvement  In 2024, several advanced AI models \ncapable of generating high-quality videos from text inputs were launched  Notable releases include OpenAI\u2019s SORA, Stable \nVideo Diffusion 3D and 4D, Meta\u2019s Movie Gen, and Google DeepMind\u2019s Veo 2  Complex reasoning remains a problem   Even though the addition of mechanisms such as chain-of-thought \nreasoning has significantly improved the performance of LLMs, these systems still cannot reliably solve problems for which \nprovably correct solutions can be found using logical reasoning, such as arithmetic and planning, especially on instances larger \nthan those they were trained on  AI agents show early promise   The launch of RE-Bench in 2024 introduced a rigorous benchmark for evaluating \ncomplex tasks for AI agents  In short time-horizon settings (two-hour budget), top AI systems score four times higher than \nhuman experts, but as the time budget increases, human performance surpasses AI\u2014outscoring it two to one at 32 hours  \nAI agents already match human expertise in select tasks, such as writing Triton kernels, while delivering results faster and at \nlower costs  Evaluating AI systems with responsible AI (RAI) criteria is still uncommon, but new benchmarks are \nbeginning to emerge  Last year\u2019s AI Index highlighted the lack of standardized RAI benchmarks for LLMs  While this issue \npersists, new benchmarks such as HELM Safety and AIR-Bench help to fill this gap  The number of AI incident reports continues to increase   According to the AI Incidents Database, the number of \nreported AI-related incidents rose to 233 in 2024\u2014a record high and a 56  \nCHAPTER 2: \nTechnical Performance (cont\u2019d)\nCHAPTER 3: \nResponsible AI\nReport Highlights Artificial Intelligence\nIndex Report 2025\n16\n3  Organizations acknowledge RAI risks, but mitigation efforts lag   A McKinsey survey on organizations\u2019 RAI \nengagement shows that while many identify key RAI risks, not all are taking active steps to address them  Across the globe, policymakers demonstrate a significant interest in RAI  In 2024, global cooperation on AI \ngovernance intensified, with a focus on articulating agreed-upon principles for responsible AI  Several major organizations\u2014\nincluding the OECD, European Union, United Nations, and African Union\u2014published frameworks to articulate key RAI concerns \nsuch as transparency and explainability, and trustworthiness  AI models rely on massive amounts of publicly available web data for training  \nA recent study found that data use restrictions increased significantly from 2023 to 2024, as many websites implemented new \nprotocols to curb data scraping for AI training  In actively maintained domains in the C4 common crawl dataset, the proportion \nof restricted tokens jumped from 5\u20137% to 20\u201333%  This decline has consequences for data diversity, model alignment, and \nscalability, and may also lead to new approaches to learning with data constraints  Foundation model research transparency improves, yet more work remains  While these gains \nare promising, there is still considerable room for improvement  Earlier benchmarks like HaluEval and TruthfulQA, aimed at \nevaluating the factuality and truthfulness of AI models, have failed to gain widespread adoption within the AI community  AI-related election misinformation spread globally, but its impact remains unclear   In 2024, numerous \nexamples of AI-related election misinformation emerged in more than a dozen countries and across over 10 social media \nplatforms, including during the U  However, questions remain about the measurable impacts of this \nproblem, with many expecting misinformation campaigns to have affected elections more profoundly than they did \nCHAPTER 3: \nResponsible AI (cont\u2019d)\nReport Highlights Artificial Intelligence\nIndex Report 2025\n17\n9  LLMs trained to be explicitly unbiased continue to demonstrate implicit bias  \nAlthough bias metrics have improved on standard benchmarks, AI model bias remains a pervasive issue  RAI gains attention from academic researchers   The number of RAI papers accepted at leading AI conferences \nincreased by 28  This upward trend highlights \nthe growing importance of RAI within the AI research community \nCHAPTER 3: \nResponsible AI (cont\u2019d)\nReport Highlights\n1  Global private AI investment hits record high with 26% growth  Corporate AI investment reached $252  Generative AI funding soars  Private investment in generative AI reached $33  The sector now represents more than 20% of all AI-related private investment  widens its lead in global AI private investment  private AI investment hit $109  The gap is even more pronounced in generative AI, \nwhere U  Use of AI climbs to unprecedented levels  In 2024, the proportion of survey respondents reporting AI use by their \norganizations jumped to 78% from 55% in 2023  Similarly, the number of respondents who reported using generative AI in at least \none business function more than doubled\u2014from 33% in 2023 to 71% last year  AI is beginning to deliver financial impact across business functions, but most companies are early in \ntheir journeys  Most companies that report financial impacts from using AI within a business function estimate the benefits \nas being at low levels  49% of respondents whose organizations use AI in service operations report cost savings, followed by \nsupply chain management (43%) and software engineering (41%), but most of them report cost savings of less than 10%  With \nregard to revenue, 71% of respondents using AI in marketing and sales report revenue gains, 63% in supply chain management, \nand 57% in service operations, but the most common level of revenue increases is less than 5%

of this year\u2019s AI Index provides a comprehensive \noverview of AI advancements in 2024  It begins with a high-level summary of AI \ntechnical progress, covering major AI-related launches, the state of AI capabilities, and \nkey trends\u2014such as the rising performance of open-weight models, the convergence \nof frontier model performance, and the improving quality of Chinese LLMs  The \nchapter then examines the current state of various AI capabilities, including language \nunderstanding and generation, retrieval-augmented generation, coding, mathematics, \nreasoning, computer vision, speech, and agentic AI  AI masters new benchmarks faster than ever   In 2023, AI researchers introduced several challenging new \nbenchmarks, including MMMU, GPQA, and SWE-bench, aimed at testing the limits of increasingly capable AI systems  By 2024, \nAI performance on these benchmarks saw remarkable improvements, with gains of 18  On SWE-bench, AI systems could solve just 4  AI model performance converges at the frontier  According to last year\u2019s AI Index, the Elo score difference between \nthe top and 10th-ranked model on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard was 11  The AI landscape is \nbecoming increasingly competitive, with high-quality models now available from a growing number of developers  Last year\u2019s AI Index revealed that leading open-weight models lagged significantly \nbehind their closed-weight counterparts  In 2024, OpenAI introduced \nmodels like o1 and o3 that are designed to iteratively reason through their outputs  The saturation of traditional AI benchmarks like MMLU, \nGSM8K, and HumanEval, coupled with improved performance on newer, more challenging benchmarks such as MMMU and \nGPQA, has pushed researchers to explore additional evaluation methods for leading AI systems 80%; FrontierMath, a complex mathematics \nbenchmark where AI systems solve only 2% of problems; and BigCodeBench, a coding benchmark where AI systems achieve a \n35  Complex reasoning remains a problem   Even though the addition of mechanisms such as chain-of-thought \nreasoning has significantly improved the performance of LLMs, these systems still cannot reliably solve problems for which \nprovably correct solutions can be found using logical reasoning, such as arithmetic and planning, especially on instances larger \nthan those they were trained on  High-quality AI video generators demonstrate significant improvement  In 2024, several advanced AI models \ncapable of generating high-quality videos from text inputs were launched  Notable releases include OpenAI\u2019s SORA, Stable \nVideo 3D and 4D, Meta\u2019s Movie Gen, and Google DeepMind\u2019s Veo 2  AI agents show early promise  The launch of RE-Bench in 2024 introduced a rigorous benchmark for evaluating \ncomplex tasks for AI agents  In short time-horizon settings (two-hour budget), top AI systems score four times higher than human \nexperts, but as the time budget increases, human performance surpasses AI\u2014outscoring it two to one at 32 hours  AI agents \nalready match human expertise in select tasks, such as writing Triton kernels, while delivering results faster and at lower costs  \nCHAPTER 2: \nTechnical Performance\nArtificial Intelligence\nIndex Report 2025 88\nArtificial Intelligence\nIndex Report 2025Table of Contents Chapter 2 Preview\nTimeline:

AI\nFor years, the AI Index has used benchmarks to monitor the \ntechnical progress of AI systems over time  While benchmarks \nremain a key tool in this effort, it is important to acknowledge \ntheir limitations and guide the community toward more \neffective benchmarking practices \nAs noted in last year\u2019s AI Index, many prominent AI benchmarks \nare reaching saturation  With AI systems advancing rapidly, \neven newly designed, more challenging tests often remain \nrelevant for only a few years  \nTo truly assess the capabilities of AI systems, more rigorous \nand comprehensive evaluations are needed  For example, when Google launched Gemini Ultra, \nit reported an MMLU benchmark score using a chain-of-\nthought prompting technique that other developers did not \nuse  Benchmarks are effective \nfor evaluating certain intelligent capabilities, such as vision \nand language, where tasks are discrete\u2014e  \nHowever, developing benchmarks is more challenging in \nareas of AI such as multi-agent systems and human-AI \ninteraction because of factors including the variability in \nhuman behaviors and the sheer diversity of correct answers \nIn addition, AI advances have traditionally been evaluated in \ncompetitions designed to measure human performance, such \nas games and other open challenges posed to humans or \nmachines  Games such as chess and poker involve significant \nintelligence, and AI systems have improved over the decades \nto the point of defeating the best humans at increasingly \ncomplex games  Games with a physical component or team \ncapabilities are also a good measure of progress for AI, and \nthe robotics community has embarked on challenging game \ncompetitions such as RoboCup for soccer-playing robots  \nAnother area of AI where competitions are used involves \ncoordination and teamwork where multi-agent systems \ndemonstrate advances in distributed reasoning \nBenchmarks have been developed by the AI community \nfor a very long time  Significant advances in AI have been \npossible because different approaches and methods could \nbe evaluated against the same gold standard represented \nby a benchmark  In machine learning, benchmarks with \ndifferent kinds of data in diverse domains have enabled \nsignificant advances  Many of these benchmarks are \nevaluated automatically by a third party without releasing the \ntest data to the AI developers, which makes the evaluations \nmore trustworthy  This is a \nvery important AI advance concerning the integration of \notherwise separate intelligent tasks and capabilities \nThe rapid progress of AI systems, evidenced by their consistent \noutperformance on benchmarks, is perhaps best illustrated \nby the diminishing relevance of the well-known and long-\nstanding challenge for AI: the Turing test 1 Overview of AI in 2024\nChapter 2: Technical Performance 102\nArtificial Intelligence\nIndex Report 2025Table of Contents Chapter 2 Preview\njudge cannot reliably distinguish between them, the machine \nis said to have passed the Turing test  Recent evidence \nsuggests that LLMs have advanced so significantly that people \nstruggle to differentiate the best-performing language models \nfrom a human, signaling that modern AI models can pass the \nTuring test  While the merits and shortfalls of this test have \nlong been debated, it remains an important historical and \ncultural benchmark for machine intelligence  The questioning \nof its relevance highlights the remarkable progress of LLMs in \nrecent years and the evolving perception of effective computer \nscience benchmarks and AI measurement  \nBenchmarks can also suffer from contamination, where LLMs \nencounter test questions that were present in their training \ndata  Some researchers have \nsought to combat these contamination issues by introducing \nbenchmarks like LiveBench, which are periodically updated \nwith new questions from unfamiliar sources that LLMs are \nunlikely to have seen in their training data  In BetterBench, researchers systematically \nanalyzed 24 prominent benchmarks and identified systemic \ndeficiencies: 14 failed to report statistical significance, 17 \nlacked scripts for result replication, and most suffered from \ninadequate documentation, limiting their reproducibility and \neffectiveness in evaluating models  To address these issues, the paper pro-\nposed a 46-criteria framework covering all phases of bench-\nmark development\u2014design, implementation, documenta-\ntion, and maintenance (Figure 2  These

year\u2019s AI Index highlighted the lack of standardized RAI benchmarks for LLMs  While this issue persists, new \nbenchmarks such as HELM Safety and AIR-Bench help to fill this gap  The number of AI incident reports continues to increase  According to the AI Incidents Database, the number of \nreported AI-related incidents rose to 233 in 2024\u2014a record high and a 56  Organizations acknowledge RAI risks, but mitigation efforts lag   A McKinsey survey on organizations\u2019 RAI \nengagement shows that while many identify key RAI risks, not all are taking active steps to address them  Across the globe, policymakers demonstrate a significant interest in RAI  In 2024, global cooperation on AI \ngovernance intensified, with a focus on articulating agreed-upon principles for responsible AI  Several major organizations\u2014\nincluding the OECD, European Union, United Nations, and African Union\u2014published frameworks to articulate key RAI concerns \nsuch as transparency and explainability, and trustworthiness  AI models rely on massive amounts of publicly available web data for training  \nA recent study found that data use restrictions increased significantly from 2023 to 2024, as many websites implemented new \nprotocols to curb data scraping for AI training  In actively maintained domains in the C4 common crawl dataset, the proportion \nof restricted tokens jumped from 5\u20137% to 20\u201333%  This decline has consequences for data diversity, model alignment, and \nscalability, and may also lead to new approaches to learning with data constraints \nCHAPTER 3:

room for improvement  LLMs trained to be explicitly unbiased continue to demonstrate implicit bias  \nAlthough bias metrics have improved on standard benchmarks, AI model bias remains a pervasive issue  RAI gains attention from academic researchers   The number of RAI papers accepted at leading AI conferences \nincreased by 28  This upward trend highlights \nthe growing importance of RAI within the AI research community   Earlier benchmarks like HaluEval and TruthfulQA, aimed at \nevaluating the factuality and truthfulness of AI models, have failed to gain widespread adoption within

anonymity, \nand protection of their personal data, along with their right \nto consent to and be informed about if and how their data is \nused  In \nAI, this involves ensuring that personal data is handled in a \nway that respects individual privacy rights\u2014for example, by \nimplementing measures to protect sensitive information from \nexposure, and ensuring that data collection and processing are \ntransparent and compliant with privacy laws like GDPR  In the context of AI, data governance is \nimportant for ensuring that the data used for training and \noperating AI systems is accurate, fair, and used responsibly \nand with consent \nLarge-Scale Audit of Dataset Licensing and \nAttribution in AI\nCurrent foundation models are being trained on massive \namounts of data  A team of researchers conducted a large-\nscale audit of over 1,800 text datasets widely used for training \nsuch models and uncovered systemic issues in dataset \nlicensing and attribution 6 Privacy and Data Governance\nChapter 3: Responsible AI\nFigure 3 1 provides a detailed visualization of the \nresearchers\u2019 findings  \nLicense misattribution in datasets is significant because it \ncreates legal and ethical risks in AI development  If datasets \nused to train foundation models are mislabeled or misattributed, \nAI developers may unknowingly violate copyright laws, data \nusage policies, or privacy regulations  This can lead to legal \nliabilities, challenges in ensuring fair compensation for data \ncreators, and potential biases in models due to the exclusion \nof properly licensed data  Additionally, unclear licensing can \nhinder transparency, accountability, and reproducibility in \nAI research, which can make it difficult for researchers and \norganizations to verify or audit model training data  Based \non their findings, the authors highlight the need for clear \ndocumentation, improved standards, and responsible licensing \npractices to foster inclusivity and mitigate risks that stem from \nirresponsible or unlawful data uses in AI development and \ndeployment \nData Consent in Crisis\nAI models rely heavily on massive, publicly available web data \nfor training  A recent study  conducted a longitudinal audit \nof consent protocols for web domains used in AI training \ndatasets, including C4, RefinedWeb, and Dolma, analyzing \n14,000 web domains  These consent protocols define the \npermissibility of data scraping for AI model training \nThe researchers observed a significant increase in data use \nrestrictions between 2023 and 2024, as many websites \nimplemented new protocols to limit data scraping for AI \ntraining txt files and terms of service, explicitly \nprohibiting AI training use \n12 For \nexample, the proportion

encounter the highest level of restrictions, \nwhile smaller developers face fewer barriers  These findings highlight the \nneed for updated consent protocols that address AI-specific \nchallenges  Additionally, the study suggests a decline in publicly \navailable web data for AI training, with potential consequences \nfor data diversity, model alignment, and scalability  Many recent \nAI

highlights research on the impact of racial \nclassification in multimodal models and the measurement of \nimplicit bias in explicitly unbiased LLMs \nRacial Classification in Multimodal Models\nRecently, researchers have explored how dataset scaling \naffects racial and gender biases in vision-language models \n(VLMs)  Evaluating 14 VLMs trained on LAION-400M and \nLAION-2B (popular datasets for training vision-language \nmodels) using the Chicago Face Dataset (CFD), the study \nfound that while models trained on larger datasets improve \nhuman classification\u2014reducing misidentification of \nnonhuman entities like gorillas or orangutans\u2014they also \namplify racial biases, especially in larger models 2 illustrates how the probability of a face being \nassigned a specific label (such as animal or criminal) changes \nby demographic group across various models (the smaller \nViT-B-16 and ViT-B-32 with the larger ViT-L-14) as the \npretrained dataset scales from 400 million to 2 billion images 7 Fairness and Bias\nChapter 3: Responsible AI\nFairness in AI emphasizes developing systems that are \nequitable and avoid perpetuating bias or discrimination \nagainst any individual or group  It involves considering the \ndiverse needs and circumstances of all stakeholders impacted \nby AI use  Fairness extends beyond a technical concept and \nembodies broader social standards related to equity  In the \nlarger model, ViT-L, increasing the training data consistently \nraises the likelihood of an image being classified as a criminal  The researchers suggest that \nwhen it comes to vision models, scaling may also introduce \nother unintended bias problems  The authors suggest that \nstereotypes in the training data may explain these results  \nTo address this bias, they advocate for transparent dataset \ncuration, detailed hyperparameter documentation, and open \naccess for independent audits 7 Fairness and Bias\nChapter 3: Responsible AI\n13

Research \nBeyond Shallow Safety Alignment\nIn 2024, an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists \nintroduced the concept of shallow safety alignment\u2014the \nidea that AI systems are often trained to be safe in superficial \nand ineffective ways  However, if the same \nrequest is framed in a way that induces the model to begin \nits response with \u201cSure, here\u2019s a detailed guide,\u201d it is far more \nlikely to continue generating harmful content  To address this issue, \nresearchers proposed two key solutions: expanding training \ndata to include examples where the model learns to recover \nfrom harmful responses and redirect them toward safe refusals, \nand regularizing initial word choices, ensuring that even if the \nmodel starts with an unusual response, it still maintains its \nsafety constraints 8% in certain cases  This research highlights a \nneed for deeper and more resilient alignment strategies to \nprevent the manipulation of AI safety mechanisms

training methods often \nteach models to conceal such behavior rather \nthan removing it entirely  A new approach, \ntargeted latent adversarial training (LAT), takes \na more precise strategy by actively exposing a \nmodel\u2019s weaknesses during training to make it \nmore robust against adversarial attacks (Figure \n3  For example, in \ntests against jailbreaking attempts (where \nusers try to bypass a model\u2019s safeguards), LAT \nreduced computational costs by 700 times \nwhile maintaining strong performance on \nregular tasks 9 Security and Safety\nChapter 3: Responsible

\nindustry-specific solutions \nThis chapter examines AI-related economic trends using data from Lightcast, LinkedIn, \nQuid, McKinsey and the International Federation of Robotics (IFR)  It begins by analyzing \nAI-related occupations, covering labor demand, hiring trends, skill penetration, and \ntalent availability  The chapter then explores corporate investment in AI, including \na section focused specifically on generative AI  Finally, it assesses AI\u2019s productivity \nimpact as well as robot installations across various sectors  Global private AI investment hits record high with 26% growth  Corporate AI investment reached $252  Use of AI climbs to unprecedented levels  In 2024, the proportion of survey respondents reporting AI use by their \norganizations jumped to 78% from 55% in 2023  Similarly, the number of respondents who reported using generative AI in at \nleast one business function more than doubled\u2014from 33% in 2023 to 71% last year  Generative AI funding soars  Private investment in generative AI reached $33  The sector now represents more than 20% of all AI-related private investment  widens its lead in global AI private investment  private AI

journeys  Most companies that report financial impacts from using AI within a business function estimate the benefits \nas being at low levels  49% of respondents whose organizations use AI in service operations report cost savings, followed by \nsupply chain management (43%) and software engineering (41%), but most of them report cost savings of less than 10%  With \nregard to revenue, 71% of respondents using AI in marketing and sales report revenue gains, 63% in supply chain management, \nand 57% in service operations, but the most common level of revenue increases is less than 5%  Use of AI shows dramatic shifts by region, with Greater China gaining ground   While North America \nmaintains its leadership in organizations\u2019 use of AI, Greater China demonstrated one of the most

promise, quantifying \nAI\u2019s impact remained challenging until 2023, when the first \nwave of rigorous studies emerged  In 2024, a substantial \nbody of empirical research established clear patterns of AI\u2019s \nworkplace effects across multiple domains and contexts  This \nsection analyzes productivity impact data from five major \nacademic studies, which together represent the first large-\nscale empirical investigation of AI\u2019s workplace effects  The \nresearch, encompassing over 200,000 professionals across \nmultiple industries and contexts, reveals consistent productivity \ngains ranging from 10% to 45%, with particularly strong effects \nin technical, customer support, and creative tasks  These \nstudies employed diverse methodologies, including natural \nexperiments, randomized controlled trials, and large-scale \nsurveys, to measure AI\u2019s impact across different organizational \ncontexts \nProductivity Trends\nOne of the most reputable studies on AI\u2019s impact on \nproductivity, particularly generative AI, was published by \nErik Brynjolfsson, Danielle Li, and Daniel Rock in April 2023 \n10 \nAnalyzing data from 5,179 customer support agents, the study \nexamined the staggered introduction of a generative AI-\npowered conversational assistant  The researchers found that \nAI adoption increased the number of issues resolved per hour \nby 14  Moreover, the study uncovered that \nproductivity gains emerged quickly after AI was introduced, \nand AI-exposed workers maintained higher efficiency even \nduring AI outages  A Microsoft workplace study established \nbaseline productivity improvements in common workplace \ntasks, with document editing increasing by 10\u201313% and email \nprocessing time decreasing by 11%  Specialized roles

$1,683 per developer annually, \nsuggesting AI tools are not just boosting productivity but \nactively enabling skill development  This research supports \nearlier 2023 and 2024 studies showing that AI-driven \nproductivity gains vary based on workers\u2019 initial skill levels \nHowever, some research suggests that AI\u2019s impact may work \nin the opposite direction  A study by Toner-Rodgers found that \nwhile top-performing scientists nearly doubled their output, \nthe bottom third saw little benefit from AI\u2019s introduction  The \nstudy further highlighted that the key factor influencing AI\u2019s \nimpact was not prior achievement but the ability to effectively \nevaluate AI-generated recommendations  This suggests that \nAI tools function as powerful amplifiers for those who can \nleverage them effectively, regardless of experience level  \nUnderstanding how AI affects different workers across \nvarious tasks will be a crucial focus of ongoing research 4 Corporate

Chapter 5 Preview\nThis chapter explores key trends in AI-driven science and medicine, reflecting the \ntechnology\u2019s growing impact in these fields  It begins with notable AI milestones from \n2024, followed by an analysis of AI in protein folding, an important area of scientific \nadvancement  The chapter then examines AI\u2019s role in clinical care, spanning both \nimaging and non-imaging applications  This includes a review of clinical knowledge \ncapabilities in new language models, diagnostic and clinical management capabilities \nof AI systems, real-world AI deployments in medicine, synthetic data applications, and \nsocial determinants of health  Finally, the chapter concludes with an exploration of \nethical trends in AI medical research \nThis chapter was prepared by RAISE Health (Responsible AI for Safe and Equitable \nHealth), a collaboration between Stanford Medicine and the Stanford Institute for \nHuman-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI)  Since its launch in 2023, RAISE Health \nhas worked to advance responsible AI innovation in biomedical research, education, \nand patient care, with a focus on ensuring that these technologies benefit everyone \nFostering collaborative research and knowledge sharing are central to RAISE Health\u2019s \nmission  As part of that commitment, RAISE Health partnered with the AI Index Steering \nCommittee to expand the group\u2019s focus to include key developments in science and \nmedicine  In 2024, this collaboration produced the inaugural chapter on science and \nmedicine, highlighting major AI advancements at Stanford and beyond  The 2025 \nchapter builds on that foundation with contributions from members of the RAISE \nHealth faculty research council, Stanford School of Medicine faculty, postdoctoral \nfellows, and undergraduate students from the schools of Medicine and Engineering  AI outperforms doctors on key clinical tasks  A new study found that GPT-4 alone outperformed doctors\u2014both \nwith and without AI\u2014in diagnosing complex clinical cases  Other recent studies show AI surpassing doctors in cancer detection \nand identifying high-mortality-risk patients  However, some early research suggests that AI-doctor collaboration yields the best \nresults, making it a fruitful area of further research  AI continues to drive rapid advances in scientific

Sources, Types, and Needs\nAI in medical imaging is rapidly evolving, expanding into \nnew data modalities, and addressing increasingly complex \nclinical questions  \nCurrently, AI is predominantly applied to two-dimensional \n(2D) data settings, where conventional image-processing \narchitectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) \nand transformers, can be effectively utilized  However, despite \na number of successes in this field, many AI applications in \nmedical imaging rely on highly limited training datasets \nIn histopathology, for example, while staining patient biopsies \nfor histological analysis is routine, only a small fraction of \nthese samples is digitized and made publicly available  Even \nfewer datasets contain the necessary matched annotations or \nomics data required for advanced classification tasks  Publicly \navailable histopathology cohorts rarely exceed 10,000 patient \nsamples, with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) providing \none of the most comprehensive collections\u2014comprising \n11,125 patient samples with matched clinical annotations, \ngenomic sequencing, and protein expression data across 32 \ncancer types  As a result, histopathology AI models are often \ntrained on fewer than 1,000 patient samples, particularly \nwhen genomic or proteomic data serve as labels  Limited \ntraining sets increase the risk of data overfitting and poor \ngeneralization  \ncohorts used to train deep learning algorithms  Most cohorts \noriginate from California, Massachusetts, and New York, \nraising concerns about the limited scope of the datasets used \nto train these algorithms  While AI has traditionally \nfocused on 2D modalities such as chest X-rays, histopathology \nslides, and fundus photography, recent advancements have \nexpanded its application to 3D imaging modalities, including \ncomputed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI), and 3D histopathology analysis  Three-dimensional \nanalysis provides richer data, enabling AI models to learn \npatterns from volumetric structures and complex surfaces \nthat may not be apparent in 2D slices  Although promising \napproaches have been developed for the use of AI to analyze \n3D medical images, similar data limitations and needs \npersist  Publicly available 3D datasets remain limited, with \nUK Biobank (around 100,000 MRI scans) and TCIA (around \n50,000 studies) among the largest  Although 3D samples \nare routinely collected in histopathology, 3D imaging is \nnot standard practice, resulting in an absence of publicly \navailable 3D histopathology datasets  \nDifferences in instrument settings, staining techniques, and \ninstitutional practices introduce batch effects, which are \nfurther exacerbated by limited training datasets \nTraining accurate AI models requires large datasets: CNNs \nhave succeeded with around 10,000 labeled images , but \ntransformers need orders of magnitude more data  MIMIC-\nCXR (377,000 images) and CheXpert Plus (around 226,000 \nfrontal-view radiographs with aligned radiology reports and \npatient metadata) are important resources but remain smaller \nthan ImageNet (around 14 million images)  Data completeness \nand bias issues remain key challenges 2 illustrates the token volume in text and image \ndatasets used to train various leading medical language and \nimaging models, in comparison to various all-purpose text \nand image models  GatorTron, a large clinical LLM designed \nto extract patient information from unstructured electronic \nhealth records, was

in critical sectors such as \nhealthcare, transportation, and defense, public funding has \nbecome essential for nations to realize their AI strategies  \nUnderstanding how much governments invest in AI research \nand development (R&D) is important for understanding \nthe broader AI geopolitical landscape, yet tracking these \ninvestments presents significant challenges  While national \nbudgets may outline AI-related spending, these allocations \ndo not always translate directly into expenditures  Moreover, \nAI investments are often embedded within broader \nscientific or technological initiatives  As a result, pinpointing \nAI-specific funding can be difficult  \nTo address this, the AI Index leveraged natural language \nprocessing (NLP) techniques to analyze public tenders and \ncontracts and to identify AI-related government spending in \ncountries across the world  Because \nthe AI Index only analyzed countries for which public contract \nand tenders data was publicly available, some countries \ncould not be analyzed \n13 This section also presents an analysis \nof total AI grant spending in the United States \nThe AI Index cautions against making direct

swaths of society, it is becoming increasingly \nimportant to understand public sentiment around the technology  Insights into how \npeople perceive AI can help anticipate its societal impact and reveal how adoption \nvaries across countries and demographic groups  Early data suggests growing public \nanxiety about AI, with some regions expressing significantly more pessimism than \nothers  As the technology continues to advance, will these trends persist?\nThis chapter explores public opinion on AI through global, national, demographic, and \nethnic perspectives  It draws on multiple data sources, including longitudinal Ipsos \nsurveys tracking global AI attitudes, American Automobile Association surveys on self-\ndriving vehicles, and recent research into local U  policymakers\u2019 views on AI  The world grows cautiously optimistic about AI products and services  Among the 26 nations surveyed by \nIpsos in both 2022 and 2024, 18 saw an increase in the proportion of people who believe AI products and services offer more \nbenefits than drawbacks  Globally, the share of individuals who see AI products and services as more beneficial than harmful has \nrisen from 52% in 2022 to 55% in 2024  Regional differences persist regarding AI optimism  First reported in the 2023 AI Index, significant regional \ndifferences in AI optimism endure  A large majority of people believe AI-powered products and services offer more benefits than \ndrawbacks in countries like China (83%), Indonesia (80%), and Thailand (77%), while only a minority share this view in Canada \n(40%), the United States (39%), and the Netherlands (36%)  The expectation and acknowledgment of AI\u2019s impact on daily life is rising   Around the world, two thirds \nof people now believe that AI-powered products and services will significantly impact daily life within the next three to five \nyears\u2014an increase of six percentage points since 2022  Skepticism about the ethical conduct of AI companies is growing, while trust in the fairness of AI is \ndeclining  Globally, confidence that AI companies protect personal data fell from 50% in 2023 to 47% in 2024  Likewise, fewer \npeople today believe that AI systems are unbiased and free from discrimination compared to last year  People in the United States remain distrustful of self-driving cars  Although the percentage who express \nfear has declined from its 2023 peak of 68%, it remains higher than in 2021 (54%)  There is broad support for AI regulation among local U  \npolicymakers\u2014spanning township, municipal, and

about AI products and services has increased, with the sharpest gains in countries that were previously the \nmost skeptical  In 2022, Great Britain (38%), Germany (37%), the United States (35%), Canada (32%), and France (31%) were \namong the least likely to view AI as having more benefits than drawbacks  AI is seen as a time saver and entertainment booster, but doubts remain on its economic impact  Global \nperspectives on AI\u2019s impact vary  While 55% believe it will save time, and 51% expect it will offer better entertainment options, \nfewer are confident in its health or economic benefits  Only 38% think AI will improve health, whilst 36% think AI will improve the \nnational economy, 31% see a positive impact on the job market, and 37% believe it will enhance their own jobs  Workers expect AI to reshape jobs, but fear of replacement remains lower   Globally, 60% of respondents \nagree that AI will change how individuals do their job in the next five years  However, a

for leading the analysis of the environmental \nimpact of AI models \nAI Publication Analysis\nFor this analysis, the AI Index used OpenAlex, an open scholarly \ndatabase with over 260 million research publications, as its \nprimary data source  To identify AI-related topics more \nprecisely, the AI Index analyzed computer science publications \nidentified by OpenAlex and refined the classifications using the \nComputer Science Ontology and the CSO Classifier  Compared to general-purpose scholarly \ndatabases like OpenAlex, Scopus, and Web of Science, CSO \noffers a more detailed and fine-grained representation of the \nresearch landscape  17, 2025, this version introduces over 150 new research \ntopics in artificial intelligence, bringing the total to 2,369 AI-\nrelated topics and 12,620 hierarchical relationships within the \nAI domain alone \nTo analyze research trends, the AI Index used the CSO \nClassifier\u2014an unsupervised method that automatically \ncategorizes research papers based on CSO topics  For this analysis, the AI Index extended the \nCSO Classifier to focus specifically on artificial intelligence \nand its subtopics  Since its initial release, the classifier has \ngained significant and growing interest due to its versatility  To resolve these \ninconsistencies, the AI Index mapped OpenAlex records to \nDBLP, a leading bibliographic database for computer science \npublications  For remaining unmatched papers, the AI Index \nused a combination of title and publication year  To streamline \nthis process, the AI Index built a title index to optimize search \nand ensure efficient mapping across the datasets \nAI publications are aggregated based on several parameters \nto provide a comprehensive analysis  Additionally, the AI Index groups \npublications by geographic areas or World Bank regions \nusing the affiliations of authors \u201d Furthermore, sectors are associated \nwith publications through authors\u2019 affiliations when available, \nwhich may lead to a publication being counted for multiple \nsectors  Citation counts are included when available; those \nwithout citation data are classified as \u201cUnknown \u201d\nTop 100 Publications Analysis\nThe AI Index conducted a comprehensive analysis of \ninfluential AI publications by collecting and analyzing citation \ndata from multiple sources including OpenAlex, Google \nScholar, and Semantic Scholar  To maintain accuracy, \norganizational affiliations were verified and standardized, \nwith countries assigned according to headquarters\u2019 locations \nThe full list of the top 100 AI publications is available here \nAI Patent Analysis\nThe AI Index identifies AI-related patents using a hybrid \nclassification approach, combining keyword-based text \nanalysis with classification-code-based identification  These included the removal of stop words \nand special characters, part-of-speech (POS) tagging to \nretain key grammatical categories, lowercase conversion, \nlemmatization, and replacement of numerical measures with \na <NUM> tag \nAI-related patents are identified by searching for relevant terms \nin patent titles and abstracts using regular expressions (regex)  \nAn AI-specific keyword dictionary was developed through \na structured multistep process, incorporating keywords \ngenerated by AI models, expanded using established AI \nlexicons such as those from Yamashita et al \nIn addition to keyword-based classification, AI-related patents \nwere identified using International Patent

models, along with accompanying \ninformation about their creators and publications, such as \nthe list of their authors, number of citations, type of AI task \naccomplished, and amount of compute used in training \nThe nationalities of the authors of these papers have \nimportant implications for geopolitical AI forecasting  As \nvarious research institutions and technology companies start \nproducing advanced ML models, the global distribution of \nAI development may shift or concentrate in certain places, \nwhich in turn affects the geopolitical landscape because AI is \nexpected to become a crucial component of economic and \nmilitary power in the near future \nTo track the distribution of AI research contributions on \nlandmark publications by country, the Epoch dataset is coded \naccording to the following methodology:\n 1 , monthly or yearly) and the national \ncontributions compiled to determine the extent of \neach country\u2019s contribution to landmark AI research \nduring each time period \nTraining Cost Analysis\nTo create the dataset of cost estimates, the Epoch database  \nwas filtered for models released during the large-scale ML \nera\n2 that were in the top 10 of training compute at the time \nof release \nFor the selected ML models, the training time and the type, \nquantity, and hardware utilization rate were determined \nfrom the publication, press release, or technical reports, as \napplicable \n3\nTraining costs were estimated from the hardware type, \nquantity, and time by multiplying the hourly cloud rental rates \n(at the time of training)\n4 by the quantity of hardware hours \nVarious challenges were encountered while estimating the \ntraining cost of these models  Often, the developers did not \ndisclose the duration of training or the hardware that was \nused  In other cases, cloud compute pricing was not available \nfor the hardware  The investigation of training cost trends is \nmore thoroughly detailed in a separate report by Epoch AI \nAI Conference Attendance\nThe AI Index reached out to the organizers of various AI \nconferences in 2024 and asked them to provide information \non total attendance  For conferences that posted their \nattendance totals online, the AI Index used those reported \ntotals and did not reach out to the conference organizers \n4 The chosen rental rate was the most recent published price for the hardware and cloud vendor used by the developer of the model, at a three-year commitment rental rate, after subtracting \nthe training duration and two months from the publication date  If this price was not available, the most analogous price was used\u2014either the same hardware and vendor at a different date, or \nthe same hardware from a different cloud vendor  If a three-year commitment rental rate was unavailable, this was imputed from other rental rates based on the empirical average discount for \nthe given cloud vendor  If the exact hardware type was

Northern Ireland does \nnot offer this service, necessitating its exclusion from the \nanalysis and potentially leading to an underestimation of \npublic investments in AI for the U  Due to API limitations \nrestricting historical data access, the AI Index utilized the \nOpen Contracting Partnership\u2019s data registry via Kingfisher \nCollect to obtain comprehensive data for Scotland and Wales  Some files contained aggregated descriptions while \nothers detailed each awarded contract lot  To capture \ncomprehensive information, the main descriptions of each \ncompetition call were

    "content": "Comparing Large Language \nModels  \nHow to decide which is the best state -of-the -art model  \nLSEG Analytics has a focus on AI in the Financial Services Industry    \nIn this series of technical blogs, we discuss some of the most useful and interesting \naspects of AI from our work  In this blog, we explain how the quality of state-of-the-art \nmodels is reported, in particular the use of leaderboards  Understanding the ranking \nof state-of-the-art models allows us to stay on top of significant developments in the  \nfast-changing field of AI  \nThe field of AI has a rapidly growing set of LLMs available   \nA recent trend in AI is an increase in number of new large language models (LLMs) being released  For \nexample, in only the last six months, OpenAI released new models including GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, o1-preview, o1-\nmini, and furthermore, updated these models and added new features [1]  \nAt LSEG Analytics, like most any other group developing AI applications, we are faced with the dilemma of deciding \nwhich LLM to use, when to upgrade and when to decommission older LLMs  Of upmost importance in this decision \nis understanding the ability of state-of-the-art models to perform certain tasks; we\u2019ll refer to this ability as the \u201cquality\u201d \nof the LLM  Given these are heavily dependent on the details of the application under consideration they won\u2019t be \ndiscussed further here  This \nleaderboard uses a crowdsourced approach; collecting a large amount of feedback in asking users to perform a \npairwise comparison of two responses generated by two different LLMs     \nAnalysis of this leaderboard also allows for insights into the current state of AI  A consequence of this is Proprietary models may need offer more than just higher \nquality to remain the most attractive choice of LLM   \nProprietary versus Open LLMs: For the purposes of this publication, we classify models as Proprietary if access \nto them is fully controlled by companies that produced them, and which are typically available via an API or an \napplication  Open LLMs are any models that are not \u201cProprietary\u201d and can differ by their licenses and the information \nthat is available about the data, training process, and model architecture  The leaderboard is NOT a marketing platform to promote \nLLMs, meaning when the next GPT model from OpenAI becomes available, \nit will be quantitatively demonstratable how the new model is an improvement \nover the previous generations of LLMs  Ultimately \u2013 and most importantly \u2013 \nthis understanding of the leaderboard enables better decisions as to which \nLLMs to choose for an AI application  These are about as straightforward as \nit gets; there are a clear set of expected labels to which the LLM predictions \ncan be explicitly compared  These static benchmarks preceded \nthe current AI boom by several years  This provided a straightforward method to compare models, which \ncontributed to GLUE\u2019s popularity; NLP researchers were able to claim tha t \n\u201cModel A\u201d achieved X on GLUE, while \u201cModel B\u201d achieved Y, with the \nconfidence this would be readily understood by a wide audience   \n \n \nFigure 1: Two examples from the MMLU set, which comprises of \napproximately 16,000 questions [4] \n  \nThe pace of development of AI is observed in the significant increase in MMLU \nscores over the past few years  \nStatic benchmarking remains popular due to the inherent simplicity allowing \nfor quick and easy comparisons between models and tracking improvements \nover time  \n\u2022 The versatility of LLMs now allows for them to be applied to more \ncreative tasks, however, obtaining ground -truth data for these \ntasks can be challenging, sometimes impossible    \n\u2022 Also, there is a chance of data from popular benchmarks entering \nthe training data for new models, this can undermine the trust in the \nreported results  As of November \n2024, for the 169 models submitted, more than 2,200,000 human pairwise comparisons have been collected to build \na leaderboard ai/, entering a query and choosing the better response out of two options   \nFor a detailed explanation of the conversion from scores to probabilities, we refer the interested reader to this \nhttps://lmsys  In some cases, it contains a date to specify the exact version of the model  \n\u2022 Arena Score \u2013 score that is derived from the results of pairwise comparisons between models  \n\u2022 Knowledge Cutoff \u2013 date when the training data was last updated   \nNote: Many Proprietary models are only available via an API, with the same model having different version changing \nwith time   \n Comparing Large Language Models  | 6 \n \n \nOverview of current state-of-the-art models seen at the top of the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard:  \n\u2022 OpenAI models [1]: \no GPT-4o: LLM released in May 2024, which was designed to be able to handle multiple types of both \ninputs and outputs (text, audio, image, videos), while matching the performance of the previous \ngeneration of models, GPT-4-Turbo on text in English and code   \n\u2022 Grok models by xAI [12]: \no Grok-2: the frontier LLM by xAI that, according to the company\u2019s announcement, demonstrates state-\nof-the-art reasoning capabilities 5 Sonnet : the most performant model by Anthropic with a particular focus on safety, \nshowing state-of-the-art performance in vision tasks such as visual reasoning, interpreting charts and \ngraphs, as well as general text and code understanding and generation tasks AI [14]: \no Yi-Lightning: the latest high-performance model by 01 AI, which is a leading Chinese developer of \nLLMs that offers both Proprietary and Open models that are amongst the best on the Chatbot Arena \nleaderboard  \n\u2022 GLM models by Zhipu AI [15] : \no GLM-4-Plus: a Proprietary model developed by the Beijing- based company Zhipu AI that \ndemonstrates similar performance to the best models by OpenAI, Google Deepmind, Anthropic and \nothers on both benchmarks and Chatbot Arena  \nDisclaimer: Stating the obvious \u2013 AI is a fast-changing field and therefore the leaderboard is expected to change  \n \n  \n Comparing Large Language Models  | 7 \n \n \nChatbot Arena Leaderboard: How understanding the leaderboard allows for \ninsights in the field of AI \nWe wish to demonstrate that understanding the Chatbot Arena leaderboard, and the knowledge of how \nLLMs quality is being judged, provides information relevant to important issues in the field of AI  At this point in time there were two dominant state-of-the-art models; \nGPT-4 (OpenAI) and Claude v1 (Anthropic)   \nThis dominance is displayed in Figure 4, with win rates ranging between 67 - 92% against three of the remaining top \n5 models  The 4th and 5th best overall models, being the two best Open models, Vicuna -13B and Koala-13B, could \nonly manage win rates of 18% and 8% against GPT-4, respectively  Shown in the top right corner are these two models win rates against the other three models, ranging \nfrom 67% - 92%  \nComparing the current leaderboard from November 2024 with that from May 2023 allows for insight into how the field \nof AI is developing  For a more specific tasks, such as coding, the Chatbot Arena leaderboard \nrankings indicates that Open models are within reach of gaining parity with Proprietary models  Over the past 18 months, models released \nby Google DeepMind (Gemini models), xAI (Grok models), Meta (Llama models), 01 AI (Yi-Lightning), Zhipu AI (GLM-\n4-Plus) and others have demonstrated competitive performance  Unlike in May 2023, \nthere are no longer two models dominating the win rate, instead, many of the top models perform well against each \nother  Only one pair is currently observed \nto have a win rate exceeding 70%, \u201cchatgpt-4o-latest-20240903\u201d versus \u201cqwen-max-0919\u201d  When compared directly with Figure 4, several \nof the top state-of-the-art models are currently seen to be performing well against each other  Only one \npairing in the top right corner exceeds 70%   \nWhether Proprietary models will continue to dominate the leaderboards is an important issue for organisations that \nare looking to build AI applications 1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct), \nMistral (Mistral Large), Nexusflow (Athene-V2), DeepSeek-AI (DeepSeek-v2  Their win rates against the top 7 Proprietary models, although not yet at parity with the top 4 models, \nGPT-4o, o1-preview, Gemini 1 AI, Anthropic and Zhipu \nAI models  \n \nFigure 6: The top 2 Open models win rates against some of the best Proprietary models  Note that there are \nthree pairs of 50% or higher  Note that at the time of writing, our opinion is that an AI development team would be forgiven \nfor defaulting to GPT-4o, Gemini 1  \nAlthough we view the issue of whether Open models will achieve parity with Proprietary models of being of importance \nto the field of AI, the aim of this blog is not to conclusively prove or disprove this point  Leaderboards, such as Chatbot Arena based on direct human-pairwise comparisons, have emerged \nas a popular alternative to static benchmarks  At LSEG Analytics we use the information within these arenas to gain \ninsights into broader AI trends, such as the diminishing difference between the top state-of-the-art models  However, there are two main drawbacks to this approach; \na workforce may not be qualified to provide appropriate feedback and scaling to a wider audience can be expensive  As early as \nDec 2023 - which is a significant time ago in the fast -changing field of AI - researchers behind the Chatbot Arena \nclaim to achieve over 80% agreement between LLM judges and human preferences  \nLSEG Analytics looks forward to sharing a follow up publication discussing the use LLM -as-a-judge, an aspect we \nthink clearly is one to keep an eye on in the field of AI ai/ [10] taken in early November 2024  \n4 Top-5 Models on Chatbot Arena (May 2023), Fraction of \nModel A Wins \nFigure plotted using publicly available data from \nhttps://huggingface co/spaces/lmarena -ai/chatbot-arena-leaderboard  \n5 The Best Models by Top LLM Providers on Chatbot \nArena (November 2024), Fraction of Model A Wins \nFigure plotted using publicly available data from \nhttps://huggingface co/spaces/lmarena -ai/chatbot-arena-leaderboard \n6 \nThe Best \u201cOpen\u201d Models vs  The Best \u201cProprietary\u201d \nModels on Chatbot Arena (November 2024), Fraction of \nModel A Wins \nFigure plotted using publicly available data from \nhttps://huggingface co/spaces/lmarena -ai/chatbot-arena-leaderboard \n7 DeepSeek-V2 ai/ [10] taken in early December 2024 \nReferences \n[1]   \u201cOpenAI Model Release Notes,\u201d [Online]  Available: https://help openai  Available: https://arxiv  Available: \nhttps://arxiv  Available: https://arxiv  Available: https://deepmind  Available: \nhttps://azure  Available: https://arxiv  Available: https://en  Available: https://lmsys  Available: https://lmarena ai/   Available: https://deepmind  Available: https://x ai/blog/grok-2 5 Haiku,\u201d [Online]  Available: \nhttps://www AI,\u201d [Online]  Available: https://www ai/  Available: https://bigmodel  Available: https://huggingface  Available: \nhttps://ai  \nAvailable: https://huggingface co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct   Available: https://nexusflow ai/blogs/athene-v2  Available: https://arxiv  \nAvailable: https://arxiv  Available: https://arxiv"
